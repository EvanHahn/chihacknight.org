# Board of Directors

The Chi Hack Night Board of Directors is responsible for governing our organization, as well as running our events, managing our website, keeping the books, and doing all the other things needed to make Chi Hack Night happen.

The board consists of 11 members, who will each serve a 1 or 2 year term and are either appointed or elected by the members of Chi Hack Night.

### Emily Drevets

Board seat: Elected<br />
Term: 1 year

Emily is a software engineer in the city of Chicago with a background in writing, editing, improv, and fun. She has been a regular fixture at Chi Hack Night since early 2015, after finding out about the event through an improv-related email. Emily is the founder of the Fun Congress, the special events committee of Chi Hack Night, and can often be found holding a mic and talking at people at the start and end of many hack nights. As a board member, her focus is on CHN event operations and programming (not the computer kind), and on new member onboarding. Her three-word introduction at ChiHackNight changes regularly but often involves food and bikes.

### Steve Luker

Board seat: Appointed<br />
Term: 2 years

Having an affinity for curly braces and the properly placed semicolon, it was only natural that Steve became a .NET developer.

Born and raised in Chicago, he is often seen rolling around the city in his power wheelchair trying to avoid his natural enemies — badly cracked sidewalks and their cousins, sidewalks without curb cuts. He recalls being at his first Chi Hack Night (#110) learning about how other people were using data to solve other problems that people encountered in the city and thinking, "hey, I think I could do that."

His first Chi Hack night was [#71](https://chihacknight.org/events/2013/08/27/data-science-for-social-good.html), and despite not knowing how to code or working in tech at all he quickly got hooked on the free pizza(RIP) and inspiring conversation. He first collaborated as a GIS expert for the [Slow Roll Bicycle Equity Project](https://chihacknight.org/events/2015/06/09/the-return-of-slow-roll-chicago.html) and since done work for the Illinois Department of Transportation, [City Bureau](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2HT4EU90th2WU1SUGpOQ3E5ejg/view), Chapin Hall at the University of Chicago, and many others.
