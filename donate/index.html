    <h2>Why support Chi Hack Night?</h2>

    <p>We are the place in Chicago where civic tech partnership and innovation happens, resulting in new non-profits like <a href='https://chihacknight.org/projects/2015/09/01/mrelief.html'>mRelief</a>, citizen advocacy campaigns like <a href='https://chihacknight.org/projects/2015/01/01/my-building-doesnt-recycle.html'>My Building Doesn’t Recycle</a>, and government innovation like the City of Chicago’s <a href='https://chihacknight.org/projects/2016/05/01/e-coli-predictions.html'>Clear Water Project</a>.</p>

    <p>Chi Hack Night will always be free and accessible to all but we need <em>your</em> help to keep it going!</p>
