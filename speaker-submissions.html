<h1>Speaker submissions</h1>
<p>Have a talk you'd like to give at Chi Hack Night?</p>

<p>Chi Hack Night presentations are 15 minutes or less in length, with an open Q &amp; A session after. Presenters can be any government agency, non-profit, company or group who've made use of data and/or technology to improve the public good.</p>

<p>The Chi Hack Night audience typically consists of a diverse group of 100+ web developers, designers, academic researchers, data journalists, activists, policy wonks and curious citizens. </p>

<p>A few rules of thumb for a good presentation:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Show, don’t tell</li>
  <li>Be honest about what worked and what didn’t</li>
  <li>Don’t try to sell us your product or agenda</li>
  <li>Attend a Chi Hack Night prior to your talk and get a feel for the community</li>
</ul>

<p>Presentations and subsequent Q &amp; A will be recorded in high definition video and posted publicly on our <a href='https://youtube.com/chihacknight'>YouTube channel</a>. Notes will also be taken and published on a public Google Doc.</p>
