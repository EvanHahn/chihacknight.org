title: "Online: Locked In, Priced Out: How The Appeal Built the First National Database of Prison Commissary Prices"
description: "Earlier this year, The Appeal published the first-ever national database of prices charged for basic necessities at prison commissaries across the United States.

In this presentation, The Appealâ€™s research and projects editor, Ethan Corey, will discuss how The Appeal built the database and the challenges the reporting team faced along the way. The presentation will also discuss opportunities for building on the database to hold officials and contractors accountable."

In this presentation, The Appeal's research and projects editor, Ethan Corey, will discuss how The Appeal built the database and the challenges the reporting team faced along the way. The presentation will also discuss opportunities for building on the database to hold officials and contractors accountable.
