The Urban Institute’s [Spatial Equity Data Tool](https://apps.urban.org/features/equity-data-tool/) (SEDT) enables users to upload their own data and quickly assess whether place-based programs and resources — such as parks, libraries, [wi-fi hotspots](https://urban-institute.medium.com/introducing-a-spatial-equity-data-tool-b959c40298cf), or [electric vehicle charging stations](https://medium.com/@urban-institute/introducing-the-spatial-equity-data-tool-version-2-f2a8e900f84) — are equitably distributed across neighborhoods and demographic groups. Urban recently launched a [new application programming interface (API)](https://medium.com/urban-institute/building-a-public-api-for-the-spatial-equity-data-tool-4f4d83c6f7cb) for the tool, which can enable users to embed the SEDT’s powerful equity analytics seamlessly within their own tools and data workflows.

At Chi Hack Night, Gabe Morrison will introduce the SEDT, the new API, and new analysis features that significantly expand the applications for the SEDT. He also will showcase how governments, nonprofits, and residents can use the SEDT API to automate the process of submitting analyses to the SEDT and incorporating results into organizational processes and tools, such as dashboards, data catalogs, and custom data tools. He will conclude by sharing the SEDT team’s next steps.
