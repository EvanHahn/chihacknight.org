The [Chicago Health Atlas](https://www.chicagohealthatlas.org) is a community-facing repository of city-wide and community-level health data, compiled by the Chicago Department of Public Health and other health data partners. 

With the Atlas, users can explore the health outcomes, behaviors, and characteristics of their neighborhoods and the entire city of Chicago.

It includes street-level maps of resources (grocery stores, schools, clinics, housing services etc.) for 55 community areas. Data contained in it can be downloaded and all charts, maps and tables can be printed for use in presentations, reports, grant applications and research.

It is an ever-evolving tool that seeks to create opportunities for users to use the data to innovate, create, and implement solutions to health challenges that face the residents of Chicago.

Join us this Tuesday to hear from Leslie Durr, Project Manager at City Tech Collaborative, Kingsley Weaver, epidemiologist at the Chicago Department of Public Health, and Katy Franzen, Project Manager for Clarity Partners to learn about the evolution of the Chicago Health Atlas, how it can be used, and how you can get involved. 

This event is part of our Women's History Month speaker series, which seeks to elevate the voices of women who have shaped and are continuing to shape the civic, tech, and civic tech landscapes of Chicago and beyond.
