ProPublica Illinois [has been reporting all year](https://www.propublica.org/series/driven-into-debt) on how unpaid parking tickets have pushed tens of thousands of mostly black motorists [into bankruptcy](https://features.propublica.org/driven-into-debt/chicago-ticket-debt-bankruptcy/). It’s something that, by all accounts, is happening nowhere else in the country. Data helped us tell these stories - and we know there is still more reporting to do. In recent months we’ve been [collaborating with Elliott Ramos from WBEZ](https://www.propublica.org/article/chicago-vehicle-sticker-law-ticket-price-hike-black-drivers-debt) on stories about duplicative ticketing and unequal enforcement.

Melissa and David will talk about the reporting and getting the data, including how we obtained an exemption to access federal bankruptcy court records and scrape information on tens of thousands of consumer bankruptcies. We will share some of the challenges we faced, and our logic behind the decisions and analyses we made. In addition to bankruptcy case data, we used more than a decade’s worth of ticketing data from the city of Chicago, American Community Survey data and license suspension data from the Illinois Secretary of State.

In advance of this talk, we have posted data on some 28 million parking and vehicle compliance tickets [on our web site](https://www.propublica.org/datastore/dataset/chicago-parking-ticket-data).
