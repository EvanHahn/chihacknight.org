In 2019, NESTA, a global innovation agency based in the UK, commissioned research on participatory futures approaches. A [global team](https://actionforesight.net/global-swarm/) compiled over 400 cases from around the world featuring an arrange of analog, tech-driven, and hybrid approaches, methods, and tools for engaging civil society in thinking about the future. As with most projects, a report was produced, although only a small percentage of the content from our scan was included in the [final report](https://www.nesta.org.uk/report/our-futures-people-people/). In order to promote engagement on this topic and also to support further engagement, the team that undertook the original research is currently looking to develop an open-source map that provides an interface for exploring all the cases. 

Additionally, core team members developed a game that focuses on how to design more impactful, imaginative, and inclusive participatory futures engagements. This presentation provides a brief introduction to the project, outlines a few of the cases, and concludes with an overview of the game, which is available as an open-source download [here](https://github.com/nestauk/our-futures/tree/master/en_original). Following the Q&A, participants are invited to play the game using Miro, an online whiteboard platform.
