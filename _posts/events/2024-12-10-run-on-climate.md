Cities account for the majority of greenhouse gas emissions and have enormous power to reduce emissions through local policy. With an incoming federal government that plans to move backwards on climate, it is more crucial now than ever that cities are moving forward. 

[Jack Hanson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jack-hanson-b6106622b/) is an Evanston native who just moved back to Chicagoland after spending twelve years in Burlington, VT. At age 24 Jack was elected to the Burlington City Council with record voter turnout.

In 2021, Jack launched [Run On Climate](https://runonclimate.org/) to support bold local climate action in communities across the U.S.
