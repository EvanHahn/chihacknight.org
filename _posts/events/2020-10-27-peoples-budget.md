Next month, Chicago City Council will vote a budget for 2021. If we want the future of our city to look different from our past, we have to build it differently. If we want different results, we need to design different processes.

That’s why neighbors across our city have been working to build the [People’s Budget Chicago](http://www.peoplesbudgetchicago.com/). We started in communities that have experienced disinvestment for far too long, leaving children in the neighborhood without a fair shot in life, as measured by the Childhood Opportunity Index. Neighbors came together in Englewood, Bronzeville, West Humboldt Park, Austin, Roseland, Uptown, Altgeld Gardens, Brighton Park, and Gage Park to build budgets that answer the question: What do our communities need to be safe and thriving?

This project is about centering our city’s discussion about the future on those who’ve been harmed the most in our past. We need your help to make this conversation as wide and far-reaching as possible – let's build a Chicago that works for all of us.
