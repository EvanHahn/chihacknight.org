We are excited to announce that later this month, Chi Hack Night will [incorporate as an independent, membership-driven 501(c)3 non-profit organization](https://chihacknight.org/blog/2018/11/09/incorporating-as-a-non-profit.html). We will invite attendees to become voting members and elect who will serve on our Board of Directors.

This Tuesday, Derek Eder, Co-Founder and Lead Organizer of Chi Hack Night, will reflect on the steps that led us to this milestone, how it will impact the members of our community, and what it means for the future of Chi Hack Night.

Afterwards, Steve Ediger will lead a facilitated discussion to answer any questions or concerns people have, and provide any clarifications. Feel free to come prepared with questions, or add them to the bottom of our agenda.

This is a big step for this community that we hope will open the doors to many more opportunities to continue being Chicago's place to learn about, collaborate on, and advance the public good through technology.

Bonus: Attendees of this event will get the first opportunity to become a Chi Hack Night Voting Member!
