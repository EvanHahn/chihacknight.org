title: "Online: ChicagoAQI and The Political Technology of Air Monitors"
description: "On February 3rd, Neighbors For Environmental Justice (N4EJ) released a new tool called ChicagoAQI that lets people suggest locations for city air monitors and explore environmental risks and exposures in their neighborhood. The app is available in English, Spanish, and Chinese. Like air monitors, ChicagoAQI is both a data tool and an organizing tool. In this session, Anthony Moser from N4EJ talks about why they decided to make ChicagoAQI, how thinking about it as a tool for organizing shaped the design beyond data requirements, and how data and design choices are inherently political."

On February 3rd, Neighbors For Environmental Justice ([N4EJ](http://n4ej.org/)) released a new tool called ChicagoAQI that lets people suggest locations for city air monitors and explore environmental risks and exposures in their neighborhood. The app is available in English, Spanish, and Chinese.

Like air monitors, [ChicagoAQI](http://chicagoaqi.com/) is both a data tool and an organizing tool. In this session, Anthony Moser from N4EJ talks about why they decided to make ChicagoAQI, how thinking about it as a tool for organizing shaped the design beyond data requirements, and how data and design choices are inherently political.
