[Tech Month Chicago](https://techmonthchicago.com/) is a month of technology awareness for the Chicagoland area showcasing the depth and diversity of our local tech culture featuring community events in technology, engineering, math, and science in Chicago and the surrounding area during the month of September. 

In this presentation, [Melanie Adcock](https://www.linkedin.com/in/melanieadcock), founder of Tech Month Chicago, will discuss the first three years of learning, development, successes, and failures of this maturing civic concept. Her goal in giving this talk is to get feedback and ideas from the community at large and start a regular breakout group at Chi Hack Night to involve the civic tech and hacking community and work on organizing the awareness month together. 

Melanie Adcock is an experienced sales and marketing professional in the technology industry. In addition to founding Tech Month Chicago, she also founded a successful technology-related writing company and hosts a radio broadcast called Tech Scene Chicago that focuses on technology-focused meetups and event series in and around the Chicagoland area. Prior to entering the technology industry, Melanie was a college teacher for art and design.
