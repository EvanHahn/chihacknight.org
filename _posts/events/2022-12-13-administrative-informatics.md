**Presenter** 

The public data science movement began to emerge in the early 2010s, anchored in smart cities and public policy research. Since that time, the movement has witnessed accelerating growth, but despite substantial investment, most government and nonprofit agencies lack capacity for digital transformation. Could reorienting current approaches to public data science provide a more direct framework for addressing public problems?

Join Dr. Stephen Kleinschmit, Director of the [MS in Civic Analytics program at the University of Illinois Chicago](https://cuppa.uic.edu/academics/pa/pa-programs/master-of-science-in-civic-analytics/), as he discusses administrative informatics, an emerging movement grounded in the data needs of local, state and federal agencies.
