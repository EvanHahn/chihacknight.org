These are exciting times in Chicago politics! Come and celebrate democracy with us as we watch the election results come in and get ready for the next era of this city.  

As we watch the returns come in, we'll eat and work on projects. If you’d like to bring dishes, drinks, snacks or desserts, [fill out your name and what you’re bringing here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q3M-Dw0igu7aeIqP8NdBheMNvifyryE8ZeXpKF6w9Xg/edit?usp=sharing)!

**Bonus**: Name your dish with a political pun, like “Don’t Arugula About Politics”, “Bad Polling Modelos” or “FiveThirtyEight Spice Chicken”. You'll win extra fun!
