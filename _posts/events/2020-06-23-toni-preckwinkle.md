Cook County is no stranger to disasters, both manmade and natural. Labor movements, civil rights actions, flooding, the heat wave of 1995 and the 2008 mortgage crisis have made their mark on Cook County, and Cook County government responded in various ways to each crisis. The circumstances we find ourselves in today, while challenging, are not unprecedented, though Cook County’s response has changed dramatically: today, Cook County government uses an equitable approach to respond to crisis, bring policy into action, and refine operations.

Join us for a conversation with Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle to discuss Cook County's initial, rapid response to the COVID-19 crisis and her priorities for an equitable recovery over the next two years. She's bringing the County's Chief Information Officer, Chief Technology Officer and Chief Data Officer to take your questions and provide updates on the County's progress toward its goals. Throughout the pandemic, Cook County has prioritized transparency and is renewing its focus on advancing digital equity.
