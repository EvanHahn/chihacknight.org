title: "Why we need to end gerrymandering, together"
description: "Why should you care about ending gerrymandering? Gerrymandering is a form of voter suppression. Both major political parties do it. They draw political districts to protect incumbents, advantage their own party and disadvantage the other. After the census, all districts are redrawn to reflect population changes. When those districts are gerrymandered, or rigged, some in our communities lose their representation and right to effectively petition their governments."

Why should you care about ending gerrymandering? Gerrymandering is a form of voter suppression.

Both major political parties do it. They draw political districts to protect incumbents, advantage their own party and disadvantage the other. After the census, all districts are redrawn to reflect population changes. When those districts are gerrymandered, or [rigged](https://www.changeil.org/2020/07/press-release-in-the-wake-of-comed-scandal-officials-should-embrace-independent-redistricting/), some in our communities lose their representation and right to effectively petition their governments.

That redrawing of congressional and state districts and [wards](https://www.changeil.org/2020/11/we-asked-chicagoans-should-people-in-communities-help-shape-the-citys-next-ward-remap/) is supposed to happen this year. CHANGE Illinois, in collaboration with many community groups is working to end gerrymandering and advocate for a fairer process. Come learn about the census, gerrymandering, [fair mapping and transparency](https://www.changeil.org/2020/12/press-release-illinois-needs-transparent-redistricting/). Learn how you can help organize and fight for a better way that ensures equity for all, especially [Black and Brown communities](https://www.changeil.org/2021/01/prison-gerrymandering-is-on-its-way-to-ending-in-illinois/).
