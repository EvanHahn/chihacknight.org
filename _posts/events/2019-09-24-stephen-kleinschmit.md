Dr. Stephen Kleinschmit is the director of the new [Master of Science in Civic Analytics program](http://go.uic.edu/msca) at the University of Illinois at Chicago. A new model for public sector data science education, the MSCA is the first graduate degree to combine civic technology and data analytics into one curriculum. Its development was directly influenced by members of Chicago’s civic tech and public data communities, including Chihacknight, and will help serve as a model for the development of the field's data science competencies, thanks to [a recent initiative](https://www.naspaa.org/data-science-white-paper-winners-announced) by NASPAA.

Stephen will discuss the emerging academic landscape of public sector data science education, the future needs of government and nonprofit sectors, and the philosophy behind the development of the program.  His presentation will also highlight sectoral trends that are driving demand for a new type of public servant.
