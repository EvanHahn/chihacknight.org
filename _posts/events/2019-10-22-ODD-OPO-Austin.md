A collaboration between the [Office of Design Delivery](https://odd.austintexas.io/) and the [Office of Police Oversight](https://alpha.austin.gov/police-oversight/) has resulted in a new online form for resident feedback on interactions with the Austin Police Department. For the first time ever, residents can anonymously register complaints or express thanks regarding interactions with officers.

These digital forms are the result of extensive research, community outreach and forums, many content and design drafts, a lot of open source development, several rounds of user testing and bug squashing, and close collaboration between many stakeholders.

Eric Sherman, Full Stack Developer at the [City of Austin's Office of Design and Delivery](https://odd.austintexas.io/), will talk about the process and steps taken to get there, and what insights and lessons could be applied towards police accountability in other cities like Chicago.
