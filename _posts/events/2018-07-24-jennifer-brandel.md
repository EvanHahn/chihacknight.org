The journalism industry is going through its share of crises: from record low trust, to collapsing business models and fake news. New experiments are needed to address these life-and-death issues for this pillar of democracy. 

Here in Chicago, a promising experiment has been underway since 2012. It's a new methodology for creating journalism that deeply involves the public every step of the way. And from Chicago this process has spread around the globe, helping newsrooms improve their relevance, relationships and revenue. 

[Jennifer Brandel](https://twitter.com/JenniferBrandel), CEO & Co-founder of [Hearken](https://www.wearehearken.com/) and Co-founder of [WBEZ's Curious City](https://curiouscity.wbez.org/), will overview public-powered journalism and detail the promises and pitfalls inherent in trying to shift longstanding institutions from the inside out.
