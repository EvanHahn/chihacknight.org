Climate change and its various impacts present significant challenges for the Chicagoland area, including more frequent and intense heat waves and heavy rainfall and flooding. Chicago's changing climate presents some unique problems, but also exacerbates existing inefficiencies and inequities across the region, disproportionately impacted the region's most vulnerable. However, climate change offers the opportunity to build strong collaborations between scientists, communities, and decision makers in Chicagoland, and co-produce solutions to both (1) reduce climate-warming greenhouse gas emissions and (2) right historical injustices to ensure all communities are resilient to climate impacts in coming decades. 

In this discussion, four experts working on the problem of climate change, vulnerability, and inequity in Chicago will discuss their group's work and collaboration between partners to solve the most pressing climate issues. We'll hear about projected changes in climate hazards in Chicago, how scientists are working with community partners to make data and resources accessible, and how public health professionals are working to ensure a healthier and more just future in Chicago.
