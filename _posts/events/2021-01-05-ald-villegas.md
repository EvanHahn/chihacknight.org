36th Ward Alderman [Gilbert Villegas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert_Villegas) has served on the Chicago [City Council](https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/about/council.html) since 2015. As chair of the Capital and Technology Development Committee and floor leader for Mayor Lori Lightfoot, Ald Villegas will share his plans to modernize the City's information technology systems.

Villegas leads what [StateScoop Magazine described](https://statescoop.com/chicago-launches-technological-transformation-council/) as "a new public-private working group [that] will crowdsource urban technology practices from companies like Mastercard, Cisco, Microsoft, AT&T, as well as local firms, in an effort to build an inclusive tech workforce, save the city $200 million in IT costs and ready the city’s infrastructure for internet-connected devices."

“We take a look at [private sector technologies],” Villegas told StateScoop. “Let them work the kinks out through their R&D, and once they’ve perfected it, why shouldn’t we take a look at following the industry?”
