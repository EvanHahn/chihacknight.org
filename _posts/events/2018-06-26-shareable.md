The peer-to-peer, solidarity economy and sharing movements are working to reestablish the commons as the basis for human knowledge and culture. The commons can be defined as a resource, whether forests, software design theory or musical tunes, a group of stakeholders to manage it, and a set of principles/agreements/regulations that govern their management.  A commons can be as large as the Great Lakes or as intricate as civic technology in Chicago.

[Shareable.net](https://www.shareable.net/), a nonprofit news, action and connection hub for the sharing transformation, has been working on these efforts throughout the world, by documenting commons and sharing resources, especially in urban environments. 

[Tom Llewellyn](https://www.shareable.net/users/tom-llewellyn), Strategic Partnerships Director at Shareable.net and Chi Hack Night’s very own facilitator and commoner, [Steve Ediger](https://twitter.com/SteveEdiger), will discuss Shareable's new book "[Sharing Cities: Activating the Urban Commons](https://www.sharingcities.net/)", explore the commons and (true) sharing economy, and discuss how we can make a more equitable, sustainable and people-driven Chicago. They will also have a breakout group for a deeper discussion.
