Join us for the 400th episode of Chi Hack Night!

We approach our 8th year as a formalized gathering (now a non-profit!) with our nation in the grip of [several crises](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/plagued-by-disease-unemployment-and-outrage-at-the-police-america-plunges-into-crisis/2020/05/29/c8329bb2-a1b5-11ea-81bb-c2f70f01034b_story.html): the continued police killings of black Americans and the COVID-19 pandemic and its resulting economic devastation.

While our community has much to celebrate at this important milestone, we are choosing to forgo our typical revelry and instead focus on actions we can take to help. For our 400th episode, we will host a big Zoom call to socialize, reflect on Chi Hack Night’s past, and to discuss constructive ways our community can support efforts to end racial injustice and help those in need during the COVID-19 crisis. 

The conversation will be facilitated and set up so you will have a chance to discuss in small groups with fellow attendees and Chi Hack Night [board members](http://chihacknight.org/board-of-directors.html). We will split into breakout groups, each covering a specific topic.

Afterwards, we’ll come back together and share out what each group discussed and identify actions the Chi Hack Night community can take.
