title: "Online: Invisible Institute presents: CPDP 3.0 and National Police Index"
description: "The Civic Police Data Project (CPDP.co) takes records of police interactions with the public – records that would otherwise be buried in internal databases – and opens them up to make the data useful to the public, creating a permanent record for every CPD police officer. The database, the first and largest of its kind in the country, holds more than a quarter million allegations of misconduct by Chicago Police from 1988-2023. This August, we launched CPDP 3.0, adding 12,000+ misconduct allegations, 28,000+ use of force reports, and 1,500 lawsuit settlements."

The Civic Police Data Project ([CPDP.co](https://cpdp.co/)) takes records of police interactions with the public – records that would otherwise be buried in internal databases – and opens them up to make the data useful to the public, creating a permanent record for every CPD police officer. The database, the first and largest of its kind in the country, holds more than a quarter million allegations of misconduct by Chicago Police from 1988-2023. This August, we launched CPDP 3.0, adding 12,000+ misconduct allegations, 28,000+ use of force reports, and 1,500 lawsuit settlements.

In September of 2024, we launched the [National Police Index](https://invisible.institute/national-police-index) - a [new data tool](http://national.cpdp.co/) for residents of 17 states to access the employment history for all law enforcement officers in the state.

Join the data team from Invisible Institute for an overview of the tools and discussion about ways to use this open data.
