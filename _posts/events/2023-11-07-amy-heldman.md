During this session, Amy will explore with participants a recently launched unique online parcel database and watershed analysis tool, [the Natural Solutions Tool](https://web.tplgis.org/chicago_nst/), to illustrate how goals for equity, public health, biodiversity, resiliency, and greenway connectivity can be achieved together through strategic investments in nature-based solutions. She will provide a live demonstration of the tool where participants will learn how different geographic data layers can be combined to reveal project prioritization strategies, view local demographics, find areas of interest, and be a key tool for advocacy.

The Natural Solutions Tool emerged from a vision for more strategic and collaborative watershed-wide investments in multi-beneficial nature-based solutions set by the [Greater Chicago Watershed Alliance](https://www.chicagoriver.org/programs/public-policy-and-planning/greater-chicago-watershed-alliance), a coalition launched by [Friends of the Chicago River](https://www.chicagoriver.org/) in 2020. Tool development was led by [The Trust for Public Land](https://www.tpl.org/) with input from Watershed Alliance members and numerous other local stakeholders.

The tool is free and available for public use by agencies, planners, community advocates, and the general public with the goal of driving infrastructure investments to communities that face increasing environmental, social, and economic impacts from ongoing environmental stressors and the climate crisis. The Natural Solutions Tool covers a broad watershed study area that contains the Chicago, Calumet, and Des Plaines River systems, touching four counties and 176 municipalities, and spreading across 1,300 square miles.
