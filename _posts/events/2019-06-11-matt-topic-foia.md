[The Freedom of Information Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_Information_Act_(United_States)), often referred to as FOIA, is an important tool for monitoring the government and holding it accountable. Unfortunately, the statute is routinely violated by government at every level.  

In this presentation, two experienced FOIA litigators, [Matt Topic](https://twitter.com/mvtopic) and [Josh Burday](https://twitter.com/joshburday), will teach you how to use the statute effectively and explain how you can bring FOIA litigation at little or no cost.  [Matt and Josh have handled hundreds of FOIA cases](https://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2017/oct/23/requesters-voice-matt-topic/), including the Laquan McDonald shooting video, Rahm Emanuel's 'private email,' and records about potentially fraudulent net neutrality comments to the FCC.
