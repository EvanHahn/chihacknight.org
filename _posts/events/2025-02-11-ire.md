title: "In-person and Online: Illegal evictions in Chicago"
description: "An eviction with no notice is extraordinarily disruptive, straining budgets with unplanned expenses, risking job loss for adults and missing school for kids. Yet lockout complaints to Chicago police have increased by 40% since the city started tracking them. A Business Insider investigation found weak enforcement Chicago's laws against lockouts: tickets or arrests by police are rare, and city lawyers routinely dismiss cases, often without documenting why. The result is that only one of every 140 lockout calls ended in a fine, BI found."
