In the 1970â€™s, lead paint and leaded gasoline were banned in the United States in the 1970s because of the enormous public health dangers lead poses. In the decades since, it has become clear that even small amounts of exposure to lead during childhood can cause behavior or attention problems, learning difficulties, speech and language problems, reduced IQ and failure at school.

While Chicago has made great strides in preventing exposure to lead, in 2013, it is estimated that almost 9,000 children in Chicago had been exposed to levels of lead that the CDC classifies as dangerous, and that most of this exposure happened in the home.

Beginning 2014, [Data Science for Social Good](https://dssg.uchicago.edu/), [Chicago Department of Public Health](https://www.cityofchicago.org/Health), and [Department of Innovation and Technology](https://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/doit.html) partnered to find the homes that are most likely to still contain lead-based paint hazards. The result is **The Lead Safe Project** - a free, API-based analytics service for Chicago-based hospitals to receive alerts if young children are likely being exposed to elevated lead levels. 

We will hear from the leaders of the Lead Safe project on how it was developed is being piloted by Alliance Health Networks in the City of Chicago.
