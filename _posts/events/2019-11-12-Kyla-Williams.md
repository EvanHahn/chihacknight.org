Sponsored by the U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, the
Professional Fellows Program (PFP) brings emerging tech innovation, entrepreneurship, and
education leaders from Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Slovenia, North Macedonia and
Montenegro (2020) to Chicago for short-term professional development fellowships. PFP
Fellows are tech leaders 25-40 years old, fluent in English, who are selected through a
competitive national search with a written application followed by Skype and in-person
interviews with U.S. Embassy and WorldChicago staff.

Fellows spend four weeks working with and learning from organizations across the Chicagoland
tech ecosystem, including tech companies, government agencies, innovative NGOs, and
university and non-university technology incubators. PFP Fellows gain insight into best practices
in tech innovation, entrepreneurship, and education, and observe how an effective urban
innovation and entrepreneurship ecosystem operates.

The Fall 2019 fellowship runs from 10/21/19 to 11/15/19 in Chicago. Thereafter, Fellows travel
to Washington, DC to spend three days at a professional development conference (PF Congress)
while refining their civic-inspired ideas and action plans for projects they will implement upon
returning to their home countries.
