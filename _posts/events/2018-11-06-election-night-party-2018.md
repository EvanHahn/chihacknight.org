It's finally here!  It's Election Day 2018 and we're ready for some watch party fun at Chi Hack Night.

Come hack and watch the returns come in as we eat, potluck style! If you’d like to bring dishes, drinks, snacks or desserts, [fill out your name and what you’re bringing here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q3M-Dw0igu7aeIqP8NdBheMNvifyryE8ZeXpKF6w9Xg/edit?usp=sharing)! [Note: Chi Hack Night will not be providing the usual empanadas, so let's DIY this potluck right!]

**Bonus**: Name your dish with a political pun, like “Don’t Arugula About Politics”, “Bad Polling Modelos” or “FiveThirtyEight Spice Chicken”. The names will be voted on and the top three will receive free Chi Hack Night swag!
