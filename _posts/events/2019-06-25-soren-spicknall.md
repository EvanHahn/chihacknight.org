title: "Protecting Queer Communities Through Data"
description: "To create safe, empowering tech experiences for LGBT+ users, digital fields need to do much more than improve workplace culture and include new gender options in dropdown menus. During this Chi Hack Night, data scientist Soren Spicknall will discuss how industry-wide data practices lead to an undercount of queer individuals, and how the prospect of remedying this undercount could pose major dangers of its own. Queer lives can be deeply harmed by careless data treatment, and Soren will discuss those harms and the many options available to prevent them."

During Pride Month, companies and community groups show support for their LGBT+ employees and customers through inclusion events, promotional campaigns, and rainbow logos. To be truly welcoming to LGBT+ people, though, we need to do so much more. The tools that technologists build are often completely ignorant of queer experiences, or based on stereotypical assumptions about queer communities when they attempt to be inclusive. And more than that, the way we treat data about gender and sexuality can be downright dangerous for traditionally marginalized groups.

To create safe, empowering tech experiences for LGBT+ users, digital fields need to do much more than improve workplace culture and include new gender options in dropdown menus. During this Chi Hack Night, data scientist Soren Spicknall will discuss how industry-wide data practices lead to an undercount of queer individuals, and how the prospect of remedying this undercount could pose major dangers of its own. Queer lives can be deeply harmed by careless data treatment, and Soren will discuss those harms and the many options available to prevent them.

Formerly part of the [Microsoft Cities Team](https://blogs.microsoft.com/chicago/) and the [Center for the Study of Ethics in the Professions](http://ethics.iit.edu/), Soren is currently part of the founding team of [AskWhai](https://www.askwhai.com/), a new company focused on providing ethical, explainable AI tools to small businesses.
