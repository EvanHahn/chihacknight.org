Instead of mixing capitalism with social justice, what about shifting the lens to capitalism AS social justice. In today’s political and economic climate, it is more important than ever that we rethink how we scale, evolve, and recover our businesses, while also thinking deeply about our collective impact on society. Profit Without Oppression, is that new lens.

Attendees will be introduced to a developing theory that challenges the popular "capitalism is evil" perspective by reimagining a world where private enterprise aligns with harm reduction and prioritizing the most vulnerable.
