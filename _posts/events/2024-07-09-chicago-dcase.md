Chicago is showcased through some of the largest and well known events in the country. From the Chicago Air & Water Show and Taste of Chicago, to Lollapalooza and NASCAR, to the annual St. Patrick’s Day Parade, millions of people participate in thousands of events year-round. 

DCASE, OEMC, CDOT, DSS, CDPH, CTA, BACP? These City agencies (and more) are part of the process that starts with the special [event permit application](https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/dca/supp_info/neighborhood_festivals.html), year-long planning meetings with organizers, and then culminates with on-site execution and contingency plans to ensure a successful event.

Ann Hickey has 24 years event operations and logistics experience with the City of Chicago and oversees the permitting of special events. She joins us for a lively discussion of how the City gets things done for large scale events and how to navigate through the many acronyms to do so.
