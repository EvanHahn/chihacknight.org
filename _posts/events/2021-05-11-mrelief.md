In 2014, two newly-minted coders attended a Chi Hack Night presentation about the dismal access to social services for struggling families who didn’t know they qualified for relief programs. 7 years later, the organization they co-built to address this gap has served over 1,000,000 families and unlocked over $375 million in food stamp benefits.

mRelief’s product and team have grown since [the last time the co-founders, Rose Afriyie and Genevieve Nielsen, presented at Chi Hack Night](https://chihacknight.org/events/2015/08/11/the-chicago-early-learning-finder.html). In this presentation, Zareena and Dize will talk about how and why mRelief has expanded beyond building eligibility screeners to creating accessible and mobile-friendly applications for SNAP. They will discuss the current landscape of SNAP access and the importance of technology in social service delivery.
