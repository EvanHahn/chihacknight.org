Chi Hack Night is cancelled this week to keep people from traveling in unsafe weather. We will see you all next Tuesday for a presentation from City Bureau on their project [documenters.org.](https://www.documenters.org/)

This is a great time to check out our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/chihacknight) and watch previous presentations!

Please stay safe and stay warm.
