It is said that Chicago has one of the strongest and most vibrant civic technology communities in the world, but what even is civic tech? What are the opportunities in the civic tech space and what has changed over the past few years that make these opportunities possible?

[Derek Eder](http://derekeder.com/), Founder of Chi Hack Night and [DataMade](https://datamade.us/), will answer these questions (and more!) as he shows off some of the civic websites and applications he has built and collaborated on, including [Chicago Lobbyists](http://www.chicagolobbyists.org/), [ClearStreets](http://clearstreets.org/), [Second City Zoning](https://secondcityzoning.org/), and [Chicagoâ€™s Million Dollar Blocks](https://chicagosmilliondollarblocks.com/).
