There's a whole lot of talk in the news about people saying "I don't have a racist bone in my body!" Nice people are convinced they couldn't possibly be racist. But is that what it's really about? Organizations are hoping to do better by having half day workshops for their teams. But what's happening in our organizations has been developing throughout our society since before the United States was even a country. It's going to take more than a half day workshop to change our organizations and the people in them. 

Racial equity consultants Heidi Massey (Co-Creator of [Envisioning Equity](https://envisioningequitychi.org/) and Founder of [CommunityConnective](http://communityconnective.com/)) and Prerna Abbi-Scanlon (Envisioning Equity Partner and Co-Founder of [Moxie Consultancy Collective](https://www.moxiecollective.com/)) will provide a context for how organizations can effectively address racism in their organization, and how to do so through an intersectional lens. They will help the group define basic terms and will share a broad overview of the work that needs to be done if organizations are committed to becoming anti-racist, including the need for addressing the systemic and institutional causes of racism that are present even when we don't realize it.

Following the presentation, Prerna, Heidi and Chi Hack Night board members will lead a breakout group to dive more deeply into the topic, with a specific focus on helping Chi Hack Night embark on this work in our own organization and community.
