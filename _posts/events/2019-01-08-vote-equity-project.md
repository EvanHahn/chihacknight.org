The [Vote Equity Project](https://www.chicagounitedforequity.org/vote-equity) is a campaign linking the work of over 100 organizations working in different fronts of action related to racial equity - they call it a [Chicago for All](https://www.chicagoforall.org/). This project has been developed by core committee integrated by [Brighton Park Neighborhood Council](https://www.bpncchicago.org/), [Chicago United for Equity](http://www.chicagounitedforequity.org/), [Grassroots Collaborative](http://grassrootscollaborative.org/), [Generation All](https://www.generationallchicago.org/), [Metropolitan Planning Council](http://www.metroplanning.org/) and [UIC's Institute for Policy and Civic Engagement](http://ipce.uic.edu/). 

The project's goal is to activate Chicagoans to share what they would  change about Chicago so that it works better for all racial groups, and ultimately better for all of us. With the Chicago Mayoral election approaching, this campaign is assembling and organizing ideas from the community both for policy reform and structural changes that they believe should guide our elected leaders. 

[Kacie Smith](https://twitter.com/kace_il) and [Paola Aguirre](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paola-aguirre-30873b1b/), [Chicago United for Equity 2019 Fellows](https://www.chicagounitedforequity.org/equityfellows), will share more about this project – partner organizations, timeline, process, resources, events – and how can you get involved. Are your ready to listen to each other and vote for a Chicago that works for all of us?
