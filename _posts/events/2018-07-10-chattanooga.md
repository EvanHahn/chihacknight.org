Chattanooga made [national headlines](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/30/chattanooga-gig-high-speed-internet-tech-boom) when it launched its advanced broadband infrastructure, now capable of 10 gigabit-per-second connectivity community wide, but fully realizing the value of that investment took time. 

[Andrew Rodgers](https://www.linkedin.com/in/acedrew/), Director of Research and Applications Development at [The Enterprise Center](https://www.theenterprisectr.org/), will share how a small community brought together existing legacy organizations in an open, collaborative way to capitalize on the initial infrastructure investment, and expand it into a thriving civic innovation ecosystem that is driving cutting edge research outcomes in a unique way.

Andrew is visiting Chicago this week to participate in the [Chicago City Solutions workshop](http://www.uraia.org/en/activities/city-solutions/chicago-2018/), an event for city leaders co-hosted by he City of Chicago and the City Tech Collaborative in partnership with Uraia to facilitate city-to-city project learning across infrastructure, public health, emergency preparedness, and mobility.
