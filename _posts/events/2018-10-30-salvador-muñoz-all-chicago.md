[All Chicago’s](https://allchicago.org/) mission is to unite its community and the resources it has to provide solutions that ensure and sustain the stability of home. It aims to prevent and end homelessness.

One way in which it works towards its mission is through data collection and analysis of people experiencing, or at risk of homelessness. Over the past year, alongside our community partners, it has gone through iterations of a coordinated entry system that helps connect individuals going through a housing crisis with the services and housing opportunities they need.

[Sal Muñoz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/salvador-munoz-20806b10b), System Implementation Manager with All Chicago will help clarify what homelessness is, and provide insight into how Chicago is using data to create systems and methods for connecting neighbors in crisis with the support they need.
