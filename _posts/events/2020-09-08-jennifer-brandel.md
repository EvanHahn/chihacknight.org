This election year is unlike any other. And newsrooms have been using a well-worn playbook for decades that simply does not work anymore. Election SOS is a collaborative initiative from a variety of news-support organizations (Hearken, The American Press Institute, Trusting News) designed to provide journalists with critical election information needs. 

How do you get the time, attention and behavioral change needed from newsrooms when their staffing has been slashed, they're working remotely in a pandemic, and the playing field is changing every day with novel threats to the process? How also do newsrooms not just "preach to the choir" and reach underserved and under-heard communities as misinformation swirls in closed networks? These are just some of the huge questions Election SOS is trying to tackle, alongside delivering that needed information to new organizations.

With the election weeks away and mail-in voting already active in many states, Election SOS is interested in hearing from civically engaged folks about what information needs they have that newsrooms could and should be providing.
