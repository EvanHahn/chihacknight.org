Every year, the [Better Government Association](https://www.bettergov.org/) compiles Illinois’ [most comprehensive government salaries database](https://salary.bettergov.org/) to review, explore, and compare compensation for public employees throughout Illinois. The database provides records for government agencies, including state government, municipalities, counties, townships, schools, libraries, and fire departments throughout Illinois.

In the past, this database was mostly a list of individual salaries. Recently, however, a number of changes have been made to improve and expand its functionality. At Chi Hack Night, [Jared Rutecki](https://www.bettergov.org/team/jared-rutecki) and [John Chase](https://www.bettergov.org/team/john-chase) of BGA, and [Hannah Cushman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hancush) of DataMade will talk about how the BGA revised and updated the database.

The raw data used to produce the project is available to users, and the BGA also makes the program that managed the public records requests and the base for the payroll database [available to the public](https://github.com/bettergov).
