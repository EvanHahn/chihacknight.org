title: "Online: Local News in Peril - What it Means for Communities and What’s Being Done"
description: "The loss of local news is accelerating. The U.S. loses on average more than two newspapers every week. There are 204 news desert counties, and another 228 counties are at high risk of becoming news deserts. Illinois has been hit especially hard, losing more newspaper journalists than any other state. This trend has profound implications for communities and our democracy. But there are major efforts underway to address this crisis. We’ll explore what’s being done and potential new models."
