[MAPPED](https://www.designtrustchicago.org/mapped) is a searchable database that includes projects at different scales in different categories: community spaces, placemaking interventions, public spaces, plans, neighborhood design guidelines, and toolkits.   This transparent, organized, and accessible index of Chicago’s community spaces will inspire our communities to explore and create spaces in their own neighborhoods. MAPPED users can quickly access budgets, partners, funders, technical information, and other project specifics that can help them better predict costs and concerns.

MAPPED brings visibility to projects by designers of color to better understand and amplify their work in our different neighborhoods. Users can search for projects designed by BIPOC and ALANNA architects and designers, share projects or firms, and suggest projects designed by people of color.

Project categories include public spaces, community spaces, urban planning/urban design, placemaking, research/studies, and guideline/toolkits.

MAPPED is being created with support from the [Graham Foundation for Advanced Studies in the Fine Arts](http://www.grahamfoundation.org/grantees/6270-chicago-design-database-network) and the [Chicago Community Trust](https://www.cct.org/).
