For years Chicago’s public pension funds have garnered headlines about their dismal funding levels.  But what does it mean for a pension fund to be deemed “underfunded”? Moreover, how did Chicago get into this situation? This presentation focuses on the funding history of Chicago’s four public pension funds and why their low levels of funding are a thorny problem. It also discusses state laws that went into effect in 2016 and 2017 that are meant to resolve the underfunding problem in the long-term.
