title: "How we mapped racial segregation in Chicago"
description: "Chicago is one of the most segregated cities in the United States. Over the last century, an array of political and cultural forces have created clear lines of division between racial groups. These demarcations were shaped by racist sentiments toward Black residents and non-Whites and manifested through urban planning, housing policies, discriminatory banking, and other practices – all effectively confining people from different demographic groups to certain parts of the city. Jackie Serrato, Pat Sier, and Charmaine Runes will discuss how they mapped racial segregation in Chicago for WTTW's FIRSTHAND: Segregation project, including the story's context and the project goals, as well as the team's design choices and data sources."
speakers:
  - "Charmaine Runes (she/they), Data/Visuals Reporter at WBEZ"
  - "Pat Sier, he/him, Webmaster at South Side Weekly"
  - "Jacqueline Serrato, she/her, Editor-in-chief, South Side Weekly"
