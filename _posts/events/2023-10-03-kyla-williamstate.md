Equitable access to the internet, computers, and other digital tools is essential today. Cook
County’s Digital Equity Action Plan charts a path to ensuring these opportunities for connection
are accessible to all members of our communities. This presentation will review the inaugural
Cook County Digital Equity Action Plan and its companion tool, the Cook County Digital Equity Map.

October 2nd- October 6th is also Digital Inclusion Week. Digital Inclusion Week (DIW) is an
annual awareness, recognition, and celebration week. With support from NDIA, organizations
like Cook County Government and individuals across the country host special events, run social
media campaigns, and share their digital inclusion actions and progress with media, among other
activities. This presentation will also share how Cook County celebrates DIW this year and other
opportunities to participate.
