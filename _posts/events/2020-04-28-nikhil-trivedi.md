[Chi Hack Nights are now remote!](/blog/2020/03/16/chi-hack-night-going-remote.html) Same time (6pm Tuesdays), but now from the comfort of your self-quarantine location!

**This week we will have our first remote presentation. Join us Tuesday at 6pm on our YouTube channel for the [live stream](http://youtube.com/chihacknight/live) and stick around after for live Q&A with nikhil.**

The Art Institute of Chicago is one of the oldest and largest art museums in the United States. As part of a recent website redesign, their engineers embarked on aggregating all the museum's public data into one place and serving it all up through a unified, searchable API. That API will be formally launched as their public API later this year, and Chi Hack Night will get a sneak peek.

nikhil trivedi, Director of Engineering at the Art Institute of Chicago will share the strategy and architecture behind their API, what data they provide, and some cool things that have been built so far.
