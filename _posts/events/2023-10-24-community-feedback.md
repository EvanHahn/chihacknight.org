Join us for a facilitated group conversation about the role of technology and data in our society. In our seventh Community Feedback session, we will focus our discussion on things going on outside of Chi Hack Night and how we might respond to them. 

The facilitated discussion will be structured around the following prompts:

1. Earlier this year, Cory Doctorow coined the term _[enshittification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification)_ to describe the pattern of decreasing quality of online platforms that act as two-sided markets. Examples of alleged enshittification have included [Google Search](https://pluralistic.net/2023/10/03/not-feeling-lucky/), [Amazon](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/09/ftc-sues-amazon-illegally-maintaining-monopoly-power), [Facebook](https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/08/watch-the-surpluses/), [Reddit](https://defector.com/the-last-page-of-the-internet), [TikTok](https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-platforms-cory-doctorow/), and [Twitter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_under_Elon_Musk). To what degree do you think this is happening and where? What do you think can or should be done to avoid this pattern?
2. Facism is on the rise [in America](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/sep/30/fascism-in-america-book-trump) and [around the world](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/26/opinion/europe-far-right-fascism.html). In what ways, if any, have you seen the impacts of this in your community? What are some ways that the civic tech community can push back against rising facism?
3. In [Mayor Johnsonâ€™s proposed budget](https://news.wttw.com/2023/10/11/mayor-brandon-johnson-proposes-166b-spending-plan-closes-budget-gap-expands-mental-health), the City will bring back a standalone IT department after an unsuccessful merger with Fleets and Facilities Management in 2019. How might the City use this opportunity to improve the way it builds and purchases technology?

Community feedback will be summarized and shared out in a future blog post. Join us Tuesday at 7:00 p.m. via Zoom!
