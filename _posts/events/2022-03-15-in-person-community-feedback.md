As we emerge from 2 years of a pandemic that upended the world, Chi Hack Night will host a Community Feedback Session to reflect on what happened and what the Chi Hack Night Community should do next.

Please join us for a facilitated group discussion to share what’s important to us now, and come up with ideas for taking action.

We will split into groups and discuss the following prompts:

1. How are you feeling about the state of Chicago, America and the World right now? Where can Chi Hack Night and the broader civic tech community play a role in making it better?
2. How are you feeling about Chi Hack Night right now? What are we as an organization doing well? How can we improve?
3. How would you like to see Chi Hack Night balance in-person and remote programming in the next few months?
4. What speakers would you like to see at Chi Hack Night? What organizations do you think the Chi Hack Night community could benefit hearing from?

After about 40 minutes, we'll come back together and share out our highlights. The Chi Hack Night Board will incorporate this feedback into our plans for 2022. 

**This event will be in person, but you can also participate via Zoom. Doors open at 6pm. Announcements will start around 6:20pm CST.**
