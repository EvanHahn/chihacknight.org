We've been working hard all year long and now it's time to celebrate the close of 2018 with a very special Chi Hack Night holiday party!! Come mix and mingle with your fellow data enthusiasts, policy wonks, software afficionados, and curious citizens.

There is so much fun to be had! There will be:

* A fun holiday-themed problem to work on
* Festive drinks
* A selfie photo booth
* Games (both reindeer and non)
* A drawing featuring a custom Claire Micklin ([Black Cat Pottery](https://www.instagram.com/blackcatpottery/)) Chi Hack Night STEIN! Proceeds from optional, but highly encouraged donations go to fund Chi Hack Night!
* A cookie competition
* A card-writing station for LGBTQ and HIV-positive people behind bars

Don't forget to:

* Wear something festive (the uglier the Christmas sweater, the better.)
* Bring a mug for hot holiday drinks
* Bring cookies (if you're entering the cookie competition)
* Bring other festive food (we will also be supplying the regular empanadas)
* Have fun!!

We hope to see you there — Happy Holidays everyone!
