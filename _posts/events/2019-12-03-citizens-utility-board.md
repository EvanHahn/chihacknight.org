With the rollout of advanced metering infrastructure nearly complete, millions of smart meters across Illinois are transmitting electricity usage data back to utilities in near real time. Whereas previously, electricity usage could only be studied in monthly intervals, now such analysis can theoretically be done in intervals as small as five minutes.

Since 2017, CUB has been using this data to look at who is winning and losing economically from existing electric rate design, from a grid cost-causation perspective. Electricity is a complex commodity, and no rate design can perfectly match bills with costs, but a flat $/kWh charge can result in significant over- and under-charging of different types of consumer.

In this talk, CUB will share some of the insights theyâ€™ve drawn from this work, outline the next steps in their research, and discuss other opportunities for utilizing this immense store of data.
