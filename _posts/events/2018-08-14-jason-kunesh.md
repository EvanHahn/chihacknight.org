If you're a Chicagoan, [Jason Kunesh is your design director](https://twitter.com/chiDesignDir). What does that even mean? He's working to introduce product & service design disciplines and techniques to make sure the city is accessible, inclusive, and strategic when it launches tech products.


At Chi Hack Night, Jason will be sharing what he's done in the first six months he's been at the city and some things he'd like to do in the future, and chatting about how to engage with the public and the civic tech community around projects like the [Chicago Design System](https://chicagodesignsystem.org/)

Most importantly, he wants to hear from you: What should be focused on? What could be improved? How can residents and the city work together?
