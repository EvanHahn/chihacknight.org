Myriam Yvette Perez, Energy Outreach Coordinator and Organizer for [A Just Harvest](https://ajustharvest.org/), will get us familiar with the [Illinois Solar For All](https://www.illinoissfa.com/) Program. Created by the Future Energy Jobs Act (FEJA) in 2016 and then expanded by the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act (CEJA) in 2021, Illinois Solar for All makes solar more accessible and affordable for income-eligible residents.

Since 2021, Myriam has done outreach for this program in the A Just Harvest community as part of their mission to fight poverty and hunger in Rogers Park and the greater Chicago community by providing nutritious meals daily while cultivating community and economic development and organizing across racial, cultural, and socioeconomic lines to create a more just society.
