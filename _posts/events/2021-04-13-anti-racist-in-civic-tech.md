In recognition of [Chi Hack Night’s commitment](https://chihacknight.org/blog/2020/06/06/black-lives-matter.html) to Black Lives Matter and the racial justice movement, we believe it’s important for our community to continue taking steps to address white supremacy culture. 

But what does it mean to be anti-racist? What is white supremacy culture and how does it show up? Over the past months, Chi Hack Night’s DEI committee has discussed and researched these questions. Now, Chi Hack Night Board Members Ryan Spencer, Derek Eder and Samantha Evans will [share what we learned in our recent blog post](https://chihacknight.org/blog/2021/03/25/2021-intro-to-being-anti-racist-in-civic-tech.html) so that we can all work to make our communities more equitable and just.
