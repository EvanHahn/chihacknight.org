Civic technology strives to bridge the gap between citizens and government, often with tools that help everyday citizens learn more about how government operates and interact more directly with their elected leaders.

Viktor Köves, a developer and web-accessibility specialist, will present an overview of accessibility, why it matters in civic technology, and give some tips on how designers and developers can ensure that their projects are accessible.
