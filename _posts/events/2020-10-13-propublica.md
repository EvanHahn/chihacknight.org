Journalists often use data to find or support their investigations. Yet datasets that lead to novel or impactful stories are rarely published on government websites in accessible formats. "Open data" isn't always useful. 

In June, ProPublica [published an article](https://www.propublica.org/article/senior-citizens-in-subsidized-housing-have-been-dying-alone-at-home-unnoticed-because-of-coronavirus-distancing) about the flawed response to the coronavirus pandemic at senior housing complexes in Chicago. The investigation depended on an unexpected resource: open data available on the Cook County website.

In this talk, ProPublica data reporter Haru Coryne and reporter Mick Dumke will describe their investigation in the context of open data, delving into one particular dataset that ultimately became useful.
