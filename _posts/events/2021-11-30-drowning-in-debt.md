title: "Drowning in debt: How WBEZ investigated Chicago’s water debt crisis"
description: "For years, Chicago leaders turned the city’s water supply into a source of revenue. Now, tens of  thousands of homeowners are going into debt over a resource they can’t live without: water. WBEZ’s Race, Class, and Communities reporter, María Inés Zamudio, spent the past six months investigating the city’s punitive debt collection system that often publishes homeowners who can’t afford to pay for water. This talk will highlight the use of FOIA to obtain multiple data sets and a behind the scenes look at how the journalist collaborated to bring the data alive."
speakers:
  - "María Inés Zamudio, Reporter, Race, Class and Communities (she/her)"
  - "Charmaine Runes, Data/Visuals Reporter (she/her)"
