title: "In-person and Online: Wings Over the Windy City and the Chicago Bird Migration Monitoring Network"
description: "“Wings Over the Windy City” is a research initiative focused on the unique challenges and opportunities migratory birds face within Chicago’s urban landscape. This three-year project at the Van Doren Lab of Migration Biology at UIUC will explore how migratory birds use high-altitude city airspace, assess the value of urban green spaces, and identify key factors driving fatal bird-building collisions."
speakers:
  - Dr. Benjamin Van Doren, he/him, Assistant Professor with the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign
  - J’orge Garcia, he/they, \#citybirds Director

“Wings Over the Windy City” is a research initiative focused on the unique challenges and opportunities migratory birds face within Chicago’s urban landscape. This three-year project at the Van Doren Lab of Migration Biology at UIUC will explore how migratory birds use high-altitude city airspace, assess the value of urban green spaces, and identify key factors driving fatal bird-building collisions.

The Chicago Bird Migration Monitoring Network is a collaborative effort in partnership with The #citybirds Project and the Lipshutz Lab at Duke University to track migratory birds across Chicagoland using technologies like acoustics, thermal imagery, and radar. By advancing the scientific understanding of nocturnal migration and making data publicly available on [chicagobirdmigration.net](https://chicagobirdmigration.net/), the project invites communities and new audiences to discover and appreciate the migratory birds traveling over the city each season.

Following the presentation, attendees are encouraged to join the #citybirds breakout group to collaborate on building tools and resources to make birds more accessible to all Chicagoans and explore the eBird API and other datasets.
