The Social IMPACT Research Center recently updated and refreshed the Chicago Community Data Portal. With more user friendly interfaces and new indicators on job quality, the updated portal paints a richer picture of the communities in which we live. We also added a new section, connecting users to external data sources. The three dashboards provide indicators on economic opportunity, community health, and education.

These dashboards empower human services and government agencies with the data they need to truly understand the needs of communities they serve and inform decisions about how to target resources. The dashboards are an interactive tool that tracks how key outcomes change over time, compares a community's well-being and quality of life to its neighbors and the city overall, and understands racial and gender disparities within and across communities.

This dashboard is generously supported by the Robert R. McCormick Foundation.
