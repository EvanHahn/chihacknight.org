**Notice** This presentation has been cancelled due to a family medical emergency. This event will be an *Open Hack Session* instead.

This Tuesday, join Chi Hack Night for a presentation by [David Schuler](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daveschuler), a data dissemination specialist for the [Bureau of the Census](https://census.gov/en.html), who will be talking about what the Bureau does during the "other" nine years. He will also discuss his work teaching data users how to use Census tools to mine government data.

With the Bureau's data, key demographic, socio-economic, and housing statistics are more accessible than ever before. Learn how to explore America's changing population and economy and use the Census "Application Programming Interface" - an API that allows developers and other data users to extract data to design web and mobile apps.

David is based St. Charles, Illinois and conducts outreach to the citizens, businesses, governments, and Tribal Nations in Iowa,
Minnesota, Nebraska, North Dakota, and South Dakota. Prior to joining the Census Bureau, David owned an IT Business consulting practice and was active in his local Chamber of Commerce.
