You might love them, hate them, or not really get them, but NFTs (Non Fungible Tokens) have become a massive topic of conversation this year, and have huge potential to decentralize and democratize the Internet. Fight for the Future has long advocated for decentralized, community-driven alternatives to Big Tech monopolies and their abusive business practices, and NFTs are one piece of this puzzle.

In this talk, Joe Thorton from [Fight for the Future](https://www.fightforthefuture.org/) will highlight the exploitative aspects of current digital content distribution models, and detail how decentralized distribution models that utilize NFTs can be a formidable alternative that centers creators and users, while eliminating the need for corporate intermediaries.
