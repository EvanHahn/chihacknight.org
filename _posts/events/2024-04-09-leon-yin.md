As firms race to adopt generative AI to get an edge over competitors, reporters are designing experiments to measure the harms these technologies pose to consumers.

In this talk, [Leon Yin](https://www.leonyin.org/) will share the background, methodology and findings for a recent data-driven investigation into [hiring bias in OpenAI's GPT](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2024-openai-gpt-hiring-racial-discrimination/). By reproducing a classic hiring discrimination study, Yin and his co-authors (Davey Alba and Leonardo Nicoletti) reveal GPT's racial and gender biases against names when asked to rank equally-qualified candidates for the same role.
