The [Chicago Region Trees Initiative (CRTI)](http://chicagorti.org/) was established in 2013 as a collaboration of Chicago-region partners to develop and implement a strategy that builds a healthier and more diverse urban forest by 2050. This strategy is being developed based on findings from Urban Trees and Forests of the Chicago Region, a regional tree census conducted by The Morton Arboretum and the U.S. Forest Service. Agency, industry, and community representatives are working together to expand knowledge, skills and resources.

The vision of the Chicago Region Trees Initiative is to ensure the following:
- The region’s tree population is broadly understood and valued.
- Collaborative management opportunities are identified and enacted.
- Measurable improvements toward the health and vigor of the region’s trees are identified and established.
- Public awareness and support is developed to maintain our urban forest and enhance its health for the future.
