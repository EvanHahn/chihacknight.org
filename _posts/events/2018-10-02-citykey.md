The [CityKey](http://www.chicityclerk.com/chicagocitykey) is Chicago’s first ever Municipal ID program that combines a government-issued ID, transit pass, library card and pharmaceutical benefits all in one. Available to all Chicago residents, the program was launched in April 2018 by the Office of the City Clerk making it the nation’s second largest program of its kind.

To create the program, the [Office of the City Clerk](http://www.chicityclerk.com/) worked closely with community groups, technology experts, city agencies and others to balance the need to create a program that could scale to Chicago’s 2.7 million residents while protecting users’ privacy. The City Clerk’s Office has been lauded by activists and technologists alike for creating a card that retains minimal information and for being the first ID of its kind to combine a government-issued ID with transit technology. 

City Clerk [Anna Valencia](https://twitter.com/chicityclerk) will talk about launching this innovative government initiative. She will be joined by the Chief of Policy for her office, [Tonantzin Carmona](https://twitter.com/Tonantzin_LC), who worked closely with stakeholders to design the program as well as [Tom Schenk](https://twitter.com/tomschenkjr) who previously served as the Chief Data Officer for the City of Chicago and was an advisor to the program.
