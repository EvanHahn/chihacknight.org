As Chicago and other cities across the world begin reopening, communities are trying to figure out how to get the supplies that are needed to the places that need them the most. To make this happen, cities need technology solutions that allow them to obtain and share supplies â€” in other words, they need to become circular cities. To be circular means to keep materials continuously in use, extending life cycles and designing out waste. 

To aid in this effort, [Rheaply](https://www.rheaply.com/), a Chicago startup whose technology allows organizations to share resources within and between each other, partnered with the City of Chicago and World Business Chicago to build the [Chicago PPE Market](https://www.chicagoppemarket.com/). Chicago PPE Market connects Chicago businesses and nonprofits to local distributors of PPE materials, allowing businesses to ensure their customers and staff are safe upon their return to work.

These efforts to make Chicago, and other cities, more circular is just the beginning. As Rheaply continues to scale the digital infrastructure necessary to procure, move, sell, dispose, and recycle used property and materials, they will continue to connect citizens, communities, and cities to more equitable environmental and economic opportunities.

In this presentation, Garr Punnett, Chief of Staff & Sustainability at Rheaply, will discuss the Chicago PPE Market, how Rheaply is using its technology to build circular cities, and the future of the digital circular economy.
