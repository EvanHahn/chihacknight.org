[JPA](http://jpachicago.org/about) was founded in 1901 by Chicago’s own Jane Addams as the city’s first provider of probation officers for youth, and has evolved over the century to meet the needs of vulnerable children. Serving an average of 2,500 individuals yearly in over 20 school partnerships throughout Chicago’s west, northwest, and far south sides, the mission of JPA is to improve the social and emotional well-being of children so they can fulfill their potential at home, in school, and in the community. This is accomplished by interventions at the child level (through psychodynamic therapy services provided by JPA clinicians), at the educator level (through teacher and school admin consultation by JPA clinicians on how to respond to children), and at the parent level (through parent-driven workshops led by JPA clinicians). JPA also has a child welfare consulting branch, providing evaluation and quality improvement support to statewide and national nonprofits and the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS).

Over the years, JPA has amassed a wealth of data on services provided and clients seen. It has innovated a unique form to track children’s behavioral progress as rated by teachers, and collects additional information including clinical data, demographics, attendance in therapy, and trauma history. JPA welcomes ideas on how to streamline the linking of this data, its analysis, and its reporting in order to better tell the story of those we serve.
