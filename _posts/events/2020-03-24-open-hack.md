This week will be a Remote Open Hack. There will be no presentation this week. Instead, join us on the Chi Hack Night Slack [(What is Slack?)](https://slack.com/help/articles/115004071768-What-is-Slack-): [http://slackme.chihacknight.org/](http://slackme.chihacknight.org/). 

Once you’re in, join the **#chihacknight-remote** channel. This will be the virtual hangout for Remote Chi Hack Night. Members of [Chi Hack Night’s Board](https://chihacknight.org/board-of-directors.html) will be around to answer questions, provide resources about working remotely, share memes, talk and create a positive space to hang out in. 

Existing breakout groups can also pitch their projects in this channel. You can also start a new breakout group if you’d like! Want to learn more about starting a breakout group? [Read this informative blog post](https://chihacknight.org/blog/2020/02/28/so-you-want-to-start-a-breakout-group.html).
