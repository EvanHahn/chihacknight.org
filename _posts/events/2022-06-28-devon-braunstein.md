title: "Unpacking Chicago’s Digital Divide"
description: "The digital divide in Chicago is not what it seems: The majority of Chicago households (~80%) are connected to the internet. Yet, deep disparities exist at the neighborhood level. In Chicago’s least connected communities, more than 40% of residents don’t have internet at home. In this talk, we will review internet connectivity trends in Chicago from a socio-economic perspective, dig into the meaning of digital equity and inclusion, discuss the City’s progress to date, and lay out a strategy for achieving digital equity by placing community members at the center of the work."
speakers:
  - "Devon Braunstein (she/her), Digital Inclusion Policy Fellow, Office of the Mayor, City of Chicago"

The digital divide in Chicago is not what it seems: The majority of Chicago households (~80%) are connected to the internet. Yet, deep disparities exist at the neighborhood level. In Chicago’s least connected communities, more than 40% of residents don’t have internet at home.

With broadband infrastructure nearly ubiquitous throughout the city, why do so many households still lack high-speed, reliable internet?

In this talk, we will review internet connectivity trends in Chicago from a socio-economic perspective, dig into the meaning of digital equity and inclusion, discuss the City’s progress to date, and lay out a strategy for achieving digital equity by placing community members at the center of the work.
