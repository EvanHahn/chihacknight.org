title: "In-person and Online: Residential Valuation V3: Cook County's Next Top Model"
description: "The Cook County Assessor’s Office (CCAO) is responsible for determining the assessed value of over 1.8 million properties. Last year, the CCAO’s Data Department presented V2 of its residential valuation model, which was used to reassess the City of Chicago. The model outperformed previous CCAO valuation models, but still had some rough edges. This year, the Data Department created V3 of its residential valuation model. The new model includes a vastly expanded set of input features, significantly improved methods, stricter accounting for different modeling experiments, and more. The result is the CCAO's fastest, most accurate valuation model to date."

The [Cook County Assessor’s Office (CCAO)](https://www.cookcountyassessor.com/) is responsible for determining the assessed value of over 1.8 million properties. The Office uses computer-assisted [mass appraisal](https://www.iaao.org/media/standards/StandardOnMassAppraisal.pdf) to calculate values for residential properties: single-family homes, small multi-family apartment buildings, and condominiums.

Last year, the CCAO’s Data Department [presented V2 of its residential valuation model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rd-xYJb27Q), which was used to reassess the City of Chicago. The model outperformed previous CCAO valuation models, but still had some rough edges.

This year, the Data Department created [V3 of its residential valuation model](https://gitlab.com/ccao-data-science---modeling/models/ccao_res_avm). The new model includes a vastly expanded set of input features (distance to CTA stops, more Census data, etc.), significantly improved methods, stricter accounting for different modeling experiments, and more. The result is the CCAO's fastest, most accurate valuation model to date.

CCAO Senior Data Scientist, Dan Snow, will walk through V3 of the new residential model. He'll cover initial 2022 results, describe the major changes from V2 to V3, discuss ongoing data issues and the plans to solve them, and provide a sneak peek at the Data Department's future plans. If you’re interested in knowing how your property is valued or in housing, equity, machine learning, or real estate, attend this talk!
