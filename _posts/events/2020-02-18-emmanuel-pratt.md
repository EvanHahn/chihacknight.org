Sweet Water Foundation (SWF) practices Regenerative Neighborhood Development - a creative and regenerative social justice method, that creates safe and inspiring spaces and curates healthy, intergenerational communities that transform the ecology of so-called 'blighted' neighborhoods. Utilizing a unique blend of urban design, urban agriculture, carpentry, art, and STE(A+)M focused education, SWF cultivates engaged youth, an intergenerational and interdisciplinary workforce, art, locally-grown food, and affordable housing.

Since 2014, SWF has created a series of urban acupuncture inspired installations that actively re-story and re-construct a neighborhood located at the nexus of Englewood and Washington Park, two African American communities directly impacted by redlining and an ongoing practice of municipal disinvestment. Within 5 years, SWF has transformed 4 contiguous city blocks into what is now known as 'The Commons.' The Commons includes ~3 acres of Community Farms, a Community Garden, 2 pocket parks, a formerly- foreclosed home transformed into community school, a vacant house transformed into an Art Gallery meets live-work space, a community Work-Shop, a series of custom greenhouses, and a timber frame pavilion that serves as outdoor performing arts and community space.  

At Chi Hack Night, Emmanuel + SWF team members will discuss their plans for The Commonwealth, an emerging community land trust that is taking a triple bottom line (people, planet, profit) approach to neighborhood development of 10 city blocks at the nexus of the Englewood and Washington Park communities on Chicago’s South Side.
