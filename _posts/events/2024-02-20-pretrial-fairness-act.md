Last September, Illinois implemented the Pretrial Fairness Act and became the first state in the country to completely end the use of money bond. Since then the number of people incarcerated pretrial has begun to decrease across the state. 

The Illinois Network for Pretrial Justice led the campaign to get this transformative law passed and is now working to hold the courts accountable to it. They’ll be presenting on the law, the fight to ensure successful implementation and the role data has played in reforming the state’s pretrial legal system.
