Chi Hack Night has been operating remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic for just over a year. Though it has lasted longer than many of us expected, there’s reason for hope and optimism as we all get vaccinated and reopening begins. 

To mark this milestone, and to help us plan for the future, we’d like to host one of our favorite events: a community feedback session. We held a [post-election feedback session](https://chihacknight.org/blog/2021/02/26/2021-post-election-community-feedback.html) back in February. This time, we’d like to focus the conversation on issues more closely related to Chi Hack Night.

The facilitated discussion will be structured around the following prompts:
 1. We’ve been meeting remotely for a year. As we look to meeting in person again, what are you looking forward to? Are there parts of our new remote format we should keep? If you were here when we met in person, are there things we should try to do remotely that we used to do then? 
 2. Chi Hack Night has committed to be an anti-racist organization. What should this community do or continue to do to follow through on this commitment?
 3. There have been several instances of employees of tech companies coming forward with what they feel are unproductive or repressive policies at their organizations (Civis Analytics and Basecamp being popular recent examples). How might we as individuals and a community respond to such instances?
4. What speakers would you like to see at Chi Hack Night? What organizations do you think the Chi Hack Night community could benefit hearing from? 

Join us Tuesday at 7:00 p.m. via Zoom!
