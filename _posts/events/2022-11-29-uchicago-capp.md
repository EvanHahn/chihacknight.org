title: "Online: Civic Tech’s Evolution: Thoughts for the Next Gen"
description: "As data and technology grow more pervasive and ubiquitous in society, the need for people trained at the intersection of computer science, data science, and public policy is becoming more critical than ever.  Almost ten years ago, a combination of Chicago civic tech practitioners and University of Chicago faculty were among the first to recognize this new and emerging field and founded UChicago’s MS in Computational Analysis and Public Policy (MSCAPP) program.  Since then, students and alumni have leveraged their training in unexpected and impactful ways to address complex challenges in Chicago and around the world."

As data and technology grow more pervasive and ubiquitous in society, the need for people trained at the intersection of computer science, data science, and public policy is becoming more critical than ever.  Almost ten years ago, a combination of Chicago civic tech practitioners and University of Chicago faculty were among the first to recognize this new and emerging field and founded UChicago’s [MS in Computational Analysis and Public Policy](https://capp.uchicago.edu/) (MSCAPP) program.  Since then, students and alumni have leveraged their training in unexpected and impactful ways to address complex challenges in Chicago and around the world.

Join [Kathryn Mattie](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kathryn-mattie/), City of Chicago DoIT alum and MSCAPP program director, to hear about UChicago’s pioneering approach to civic technology education and how it is continuing to evolve and mature.
