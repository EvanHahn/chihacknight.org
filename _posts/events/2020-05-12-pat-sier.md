Mutual aid groups, social service organizations and news outlets have done incredible work compiling resources during the COVID-19 pandemic, but navigating dozens of Google Sheets, email newsletters and Twitter threads can be overwhelming. City Bureau created the [Chicago COVID Resource Finder](https://covid.citybureau.org/en/) as a way for Cook County residents to quickly access over 1,300 vetted resources in 12 languages online or over SMS.

Founded in 2015, [City Bureau](https://www.citybureau.org/) is a nonprofit civic journalism lab based on the South Side of Chicago. The COVID Resource Finder was created as part of the organization's mission to address inequitable access to information.

Pat Sier, web developer at City Bureau, will talk about how the tool was put together as well as how lessons learned from past projects were incorporated in the design process.
