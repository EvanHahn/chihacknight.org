Some [36,000 migrants](https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/sites/texas-new-arrivals/home/Dashboard.html) have arrived by bus or plane since August 2022.  Over the last 18 months, city officials have struggled to house thousands of [migrants bused in from Texas](https://borderlessmag.org/category/after-the-buses-venezuelan-migrants-chicago/) and other border states. 

Inside the city’s largest shelter, migrants have [detailed harsh living conditions](https://borderlessmag.org/2023/12/14/investigation-chicago-migrant-shelter-pilsen-dangerous/), mistreatment from staff, spoiled food and rampant illness. The experiences of migrants inside the Pilsen shelter offer a glimpse inside the city’s network of emergency shelters hurriedly opened to house the migrants. 

Three days after Borderless’s investigation, a five-year-old died of Sepsis and other infectious diseases. A second investigation found that early [warning signs about the conditions inside the city’s shelter were ignored](https://borderlessmag.org/2024/02/27/chicago-pilsen-shelter-migrant-crisis-jean-carlos-martinez-sepsis-brandon-johnson/).

Mauricio Peña, Editorial Director of Borderless, will discuss his reporting and the impact it has had.
