Logan Square Hack Night is a monthly civic engagement event to build, share & learn about civic tech in a local neighborhood instead of downtown!

*Presentation*

Peg Keiner is the technology and innovation director for GEMS World Academy Chicago; she works closely with students, parents, and staff to ensure the fluid implementation of technology throughout the school.

Through National Geographic's Grosvenor Teacher Fellow Program,she took part in a research expedition to Antarctica and was able to share her journey to Antarctica with her sudents. Her expedition was a launching pad for her students to take similar approaches to investigate everday actions and their effects in Chicago.
Be sure to come ready for an interactive and engaging discussion around thinking about ways we can engage schools in local problem solving!

*Breakout Groups*

People are invited to break off into groups and work on projects, discuss potential ideas, and share their skills. Members of the Chi Hack Night community will be on site to run several of their breakout groups.

Food will be provided, but feel free to bring food and drink potluck party style!
