Olatunji Oboi Reed is the founding President & CEO of The Equiticity Racial Equity Movement. 

Equiticity is a racial equity movement, operationalizing racial equity by harnessing our collective power through research, advocacy, programs, Community Mobility Rituals, and social enterprises, to improve the lives of Black, Brown, and Indigenous people in our society.

Equiticity’s vision is a mid- to large-size U.S. city where racial equity is fully integrated at the policy and legislative levels into every function, department, resource, and budget associated with the city’s operations, services, and programs. Equiticity is working to help establish a U.S. city which serves as a global model for the rest of the world on showcasing how to normalize, prioritize, and operationalize a full throated and unflinching commitment to racial equity, as an equitably moving flow of resources contributing to reducing violence, improving health, creating jobs, and ultimately making our neighborhoods and cities more liveable for Black, Brown and Indigenous people.

Oboi will be discussing the vision and mission of Equiticity, and the organization's work to operationalize racial equity, mobility justice, and environmental justice. Oboi will also discuss the work needed to reimagine transportation for racially marginalized communities. He will both challenge the status quo in the transportation sector and offer tactical solutions to solve for racialized transportation inequities and other compounding inequities across domains. Oboi's presentation will push the transportation sector to reimagine itself and its purpose in our society, and recognize the urgent need to shift how the sector operates.
