Following the last presidential election in 2016, Chi Hack Night held a [post-election community feedback session](https://chihacknight.org/blog/2016/11/26/post-election-community-feedback-results.html). Now, four years later, we invite you to join us as we discuss the same questions as we assess the challenges and opportunities for the Chi Hack Night Community in 2021.

The goals are the same as last time:
 - To take the ‘temperature’ of our community after a major consequential event
 - To identify topics & ideas of shared interest
 - To bring in a broader pool of people to Chi Hack Night
 - To create opportunities for new relationships and working groups to form

Community feedback will be structured around the same four broad post-election questions:
1. How are you feeling about community and government right now?
2. There is a lot of anger and resentment in Chicago and America today. How can we as a community of civic technologists direct it towards positive action?
3. What don’t you understand about our government and civil society that you’d like to learn more about?
4. What groups or organizations need help the most, and how can we help them?

Join us Tuesday at 7:00 p.m. via Zoom for our second quadrennial post-election feedback session.
