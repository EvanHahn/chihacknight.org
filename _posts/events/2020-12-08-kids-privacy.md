Remote learning places additional burdens on schools to help maintain children’s online privacy and security. Schools are also more dependent on educational technologies now more than ever. What are the main issues with helping kids stay safe online? What laws exist to protect children’s digital privacy and security in schools? Who should be taking care of this learning? Where should this learning occur?

In this presentation, Marshini Chetty, Assistant Professor at the Department of Computer Science at the University of Chicago, will discuss her research team’s work on investigating how to create educational resources to help elementary school aged children learn about privacy and security and our ongoing work with partner schools in Chicago Public Schools and Prince George’s County Public Schools district in Maryland. She will then talk about these pressing questions and open up a discussion around protecting kids' online privacy and security in the pandemic and beyond.
