Local government bodies hold thousands of public meetings every day, but the vast majority receive no media coverage and produce minimal records. And these important spaces for democracy go unwatched. Long story short, your city officials are making big decisions. [Documenters.org](https://www.documenters.org/) makes it easy to keep tabs by [scraping, standardizing and sharing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF3s_eOQsKo) information on public meetings at the city and county-level in Chicago and Detroit—all in one central location.


This new website complements [City Bureau’s](https://www.citybureau.org/) two-year-old Documenters program, which has been training and paying members of the public to document public governance meetings in Chicago since 2016. You don’t need to be a Documenter to use the site, but all are welcome to apply and join its community of civic-minded Chicagoans.
