High-IMPACT Design is a framework and process for answering important civic questions through collaborative strategy, ideation and design. Developed specifically for teams, High IMPACT Design™ helps civic and non-profit organizations produce innovative solutions with higher impact and greater speed while reducing risk normally associated with large-scale initiatives.

In this week’s Chi Hack Night event, Adam (Wiz) Wisniewski’s presentation will walk attendees through the process of High IMPACT Design and help them find ways to push forward public sector initiatives with greater efficiency and speed.
