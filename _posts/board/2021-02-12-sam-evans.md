Samantha is a lifelong Chicago resident passionate about the intersection of data and action. She works as a freelance developer for non-profit organizations alongside exploring the world of data science through personal projects. Her current goal is to further her healthcare tech ambitions - particularly the natural language processing and machine vision used in processing things like old charts, MRIs and x-rays and other digital images in the healthcare space.

In her free time she writes fiction and attends the Chicago Unreal Fiction Open mic (virtual as of March 2020).

As a Chi Hack Night board member, Samantha intends to actively promote community engagement with diverse local nonprofits and organizations.
