Emily is a software engineer in the city of Chicago with a background in writing, editing, improv, and fun. She has been a regular fixture at Chi Hack Night since early 2015, after finding out about the event through an improv-related email. Emily is the founder of the Fun Congress, the special events committee of Chi Hack Night, and can often be found holding a mic and talking at people at the start and end of many hack nights. As a board member, her focus is on CHN event operations and programming (not the computer kind), and on new member onboarding. Her three-word introduction at Chi Hack Night changes regularly but often involves food and bikes.
