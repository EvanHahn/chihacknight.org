Joel Inwood works in local government as a public information officer. He has over 15 years experience in communications, publications and civic technology. He has an MA in Communications from Johns Hopkins and a Bachelor's in Global Affairs and Spanish from George Mason, but his favorite alma mater is Northern Virginia Community College where he made lifelong friends and took an inordinate number of philosophy classes. He has been a regular at Chi Hack Night since 2015, and he was on the steering committee that drafted the first mission, vision and bylaws for the organization. He lives on the north side of Chicago with his wife and world's worst cat.
