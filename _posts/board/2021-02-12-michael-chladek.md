Michael is a health outcomes researcher with a background in the social sciences who also dabbles in web development. Throughout these endeavors, Michael is particularly interested in exploring how data, research, and the stories they tell can make people's lives, communities, and society better. He has a PhD in human development from the University of Chicago and a BA in psychology from the University of Missouriâ€“Columbia. He first started attending Chi Hack Night in 2017, and since then he's been working with the Chicago Justice Project breakout group to explore patterns in how Chicago media outlets may over- or under-represent crime across the city. In his free time, you'll likely find him either reading a book or playing a Zelda game.
