Katie is a public relations manager at Propllr, a public relations and content marketing firm. She helps B2B technology companies build awareness and increase their authority. She develops articles and other written content for clients and for the firm, helping build cohesive brand stories. She holds a B.A. in English from the University of Chicago. In her free time, she also draws on drink coasters ([Art on Coasters](http://instagram.com/artoncoasters)). Katie’s first Chi Hack Night was [a community feedback session](https://chihacknight.org/events/2015/09/22/community-feedback-session.html) in autumn 2015 — and although she had no prior experience with Chi Hack Night, listening to the thoughtful discussion questions and feedback of the Chi Hack Night community quickly convinced her that this was a community she wanted to be part of.
