Eric is a full stack developer (who learned how to code at Chi Hack Night!), GIS consultant, and public policy expert. He is very passionate about empowering marginalized groups and the potential ways for art and technology to intersect to tell powerful, relevant stories, and has [spoken on the subject]([https://youtu.be/ppf4K9fbVTA](https://youtu.be/ppf4K9fbVTA)). As board member, his focus is on outreach and community events, managing the website, project support, and booking. 

His first Chi Hack night was [#71](https://chihacknight.org/events/2013/08/27/data-science-for-social-good.html), and despite not knowing how to code or working in tech at all he quickly got hooked on the free pizza(RIP) and inspiring conversation. He first collaborated as a GIS expert for the [Slow Roll Bicycle Equity Project](https://chihacknight.org/events/2015/06/09/the-return-of-slow-roll-chicago.html) and since done work for the Illinois Department of Transportation, [City Bureau](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2HT4EU90th2WU1SUGpOQ3E5ejg/view), Chapin Hall at the University of Chicago, and many others.
