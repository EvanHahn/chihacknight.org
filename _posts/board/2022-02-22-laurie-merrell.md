Laurie is a data scientist who works primarily with transit data. She landed in data science after stints in software quality assurance and higher education administration; she is grateful to the /#jobs channel in the Chi Hack Night Slack for helping her find her first full-time jobs in data science. She joined Chi Hack Night in April 2021 and really valued the remote Chi Hack Night community and projects during the pandemic. She was born and raised in Chicago and is very glad to be back again after several years in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. She lives in Rogers Park with her husband and dog.
