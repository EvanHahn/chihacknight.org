On June 3th, 2023, the Board of Directors held our first in-person *board retreat*! This retreat served as an excellent opportunity for the 10 Board of Directors to have more focused discussions around *what membership means at Chi Hack Night**, plan our upcoming **OKRs** for the year, and enjoy copious amounts of bagels & coffee. 

Our retreat was held from 10 am until 3 pm, downtown Chicago at [dscout](www.dscout.com) corporate headquarters. (Thank you [dscout](www.dscout.com) for graciously hosting us for the day!)
