title: "Chi Hack Night in 2019: Our first year as a non-profit"
description: "Ahead of our first ever non-profit board election, now is a good time to look back on 2019 and review all that we have accomplished at Chi Hack Night. In many ways, 2019 was the most introspective and transformative year for Chi Hack Night since we were founded in 2012. The last twelve months have seen us transition completely to an independently run non-profit organization with an 11-person Board of Directors and a 41-person Membership. And we were able to make this transition while continuing to put on weekly Chi Hack Night events (48 in total) and continue to build and support the civic tech community in Chicago.

<span>Ahead of our first ever</span> <span class="c5">[non-profit board election](https://chihacknight.org/blog/2020/01/14/board-elections.html&sa=D&ust=1580861934048000)</span><span class="c0">, now is a good time to look back on 2019 and review all that we have accomplished at Chi Hack Night.</span>



<span class="c0">In many ways, 2019 was the most introspective and transformative year for Chi Hack Night since we were founded in 2012\. The last twelve months have seen us transition completely to an independently run non-profit organization with an 11-person Board of Directors and a 41-person Membership. And we were able to make this transition while continuing to put on weekly Chi Hack Night events (48 in total) and continue to build and support the civic tech community in Chicago.</span>



<span>For those newer to Chi Hack Night, this is the fifth year in review that we have done. Take a look at our year-in-review posts from</span> <span></span> <span class="c5">[2017](https://chihacknight.org/blog/2018/01/04/2017-year-in-review.html&sa=D&ust=1580861934049000)</span><span>,</span><span> [](https://chihacknight.org/blog/2016/12/31/2016-year-in-review.html&sa=D&ust=1580861934050000) </span><span class="c5">[2016](https://chihacknight.org/blog/2016/12/31/2016-year-in-review.html&sa=D&ust=1580861934050000)</span><span>,</span><span> [](https://chihacknight.org/blog/2015/12/22/chi-hack-night-2015-year-in-review.html&sa=D&ust=1580861934050000) </span><span class="c5">[2015](https://chihacknight.org/blog/2015/12/22/chi-hack-night-2015-year-in-review.html&sa=D&ust=1580861934051000)</span> <span>and</span><span> [](https://chihacknight.org/blog/2015/01/06/open-gov-hack-night-2014-year-in-review.html&sa=D&ust=1580861934051000) </span><span class="c5">[2014](https://chihacknight.org/blog/2015/01/06/open-gov-hack-night-2014-year-in-review.html&sa=D&ust=1580861934051000)</span> <span class="c0">(sorry - didn’t write one for 2018!) to follow along how we got here.</span>

<span class="c0">In that tradition, here are the high-level statistics for Chi Hack Night in 2019:</span>

*   <span class="c0">We put on 48 Chi Hack Night events. If it’s Tuesday, it’s hack night!</span>
*   <span class="c0">We heard 34 presentations ranging from topics like data ethics and equity to journalism to education and science</span>
*   <span class="c0">We continued our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion with our tradition of putting on speaker series for Black History and Women’s History months</span>
*   <span class="c0">We formed ourselves as an independently run nonprofit formation</span>
*   <span class="c0">We recruited and formed an 11-person Board Members and structured our leadership and work into defined working committees</span>
*   <span class="c0">We established a base of 41 Chi Hack Night Members with full voting rights and the power to shape our organization</span>
*   <span class="c0">We became financially independent, and oversaw an annual budget totaling over $45,000</span>

<span class="c0">With that, let’s dive into the details!</span>

## <span class="c26">2019 Presentations</span>

<span class="c0">Chi Hack Night has been established as the go-to place for presentations related to data, technology and civics.</span>

<span class="c0">Of the 60 presenters we had across 34 presentations, 31 were women and 19 were persons of color. Racial and gender diversity in our presenters is something we have made a priority for the past several years, and that trend has continued.</span>

</p>

<span>Our most popular and well-attended presentation was</span> <span class="c5">[Cook County Assessor Fritz Kaegi](https://chihacknight.org/events/2019/04/16/cook-county-assessor.html&sa=D&ust=1580861934055000)</span><span>, who announced at Chi Hack Night the</span> <span class="c5">[first ever release of their residential property assessment algorithms](https://medium.com/@AssessorCook/why-the-cook-county-assessors-office-made-its-residential-assessment-code-and-data-public-c964acfa7b0f&sa=D&ust=1580861934055000)</span><span class="c0">. This was a huge milestone for their office, and a major transparency win for Cook County.</span>

<span>While we heard from many government, journalism and non-profit presenters this year as we have in the past, one new category of presentation also emerged: Data Ethics and Equity. Considering the global trend of</span> <span class="c5">[skepticism towards data and technology](https://www.theverge.com/interface/2019/9/17/20869495/tech-backlash-nyt-rob-walker-antitrust-privacy&sa=D&ust=1580861934056000)</span><span>, this is not entirely surprising. We will likely see more presentations like these in the future, as this topic is a natural fit for a community centered around technology and its impact on society.</span>

<span>This year we were also proud to continue our second annual Black History Month Speaker Series in February. This year’s speaker series consisted of 3 Chi Hack Night presentations including Darryl Holliday from</span> <span class="c5">[Documenters.org](https://chihacknight.org/events/2019/02/05/documenters-dot-org.html&sa=D&ust=1580861934088000)</span><span>/</span><span>City Bureau,</span> <span class="c5">[Maudlyne Ihejirika](https://chihacknight.org/events/2019/02/19/maudlyne-ihejirika.html&sa=D&ust=1580861934088000)</span> <span>from the Chicago Sun-Times, and</span> <span class="c5">[Steven C.

## <span class="c26">Non-profit formation</span>

<span>In November of 2018, we announced that Chi Hack Night would</span> <span class="c5">[incorporate as a Membership-based nonprofit](https://chihacknight.org/blog/2018/11/09/incorporating-as-a-non-profit.html&sa=D&ust=1580861934091000)</span><span class="c0">. 2019 was the year that the rubber hit the road and we followed through on that vision.</span>


<span>This work included recruiting our initial</span> <span class="c5">[Board of Directors](https://chihacknight.org/board-of-directors.html&sa=D&ust=1580861934092000)</span><span>, drafting and adopting our</span> <span class="c5">[Bylaws](https://chihacknight.org/docs/Chi%2520Hack%2520Night%2520NFP%2520-%2520Bylaws%25202019-04-08.PDF&sa=D&ust=1580861934092000)</span><span>, incorporating as a new Nonprofit Organization, setting up our bank account, and filing our paperwork to the IRS for our</span> <span class="c5">[501(c)(3) tax-exempt status](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/501(c)(3)_organization&sa=D&ust=1580861934092000)</span><span class="c0">.</span>



<span>This work largely happened behind the scenes from the weekly Chi Hack Night event, and was led by the Chi Hack Night Board of Directors with pro-bono assistance from Attorneys Jeremy Mandell and Kevin Mausert from</span> <span class="c5">[Kirkland & Ellis LLP](https://www.kirkland.com&sa=D&ust=1580861934093000)</span><span>. You can review the work that the Board has done to date from our</span> <span class="c5">[meeting minutes archive](https://chihacknight.org/governance-meetings.html&sa=D&ust=1580861934093000)</span><span class="c0">.</span>



<span class="c0">Now that the work of forming has largely been complete, we are excited to turn our attention outward to our newly established Membership and the broader Chicago-land area.</span>

## <span class="c26">Board of Directors</span>

<p class="text-center"><img src="/images/blog/2020-02-04-2019-year-in-review/img4.jpg" alt="Chi Hack Night's Board of Directors" class="img-thumbnail" />
</p>

<span class="c0">In January 2019, we established our first Board of Directors, comprised of 11 members:</span>

*   <span class="c0">Cameron Sow</span>
*   <span class="c0">Derek Eder, President</span>
*   <span class="c0">Emily Drevets</span>
*   <span class="c0">Eric Sherman</span>
*   <span class="c0">Josh Kalov</span>
*   <span class="c0">Katie O’Shea, Secretary</span>
*   <span class="c0">Kulsum Ameji</span>
*   <span class="c0">Mieko Furuhashi</span>
*   <span class="c0">Monique Wingard</span>
*   <span class="c0">Steve Ediger, Treasurer</span>
*   <span class="c0">Steve Luker</span>

<span class="c0">The Board is responsible for governing our organization, as well as running our events, managing our website, keeping the books, and doing all the other things needed to make Chi Hack Night happen. This work was divided up into smaller committees, each responsible for a major function at Chi Hack Night:</span>

*   <span class="c0">Breakout Group Support (Chair: Cameron Sow)</span>
*   <span class="c0">Community Engagement (Chair: Steve Ediger)</span>
*   <span class="c0">Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (Chair: Monique Wingard)</span>
*   <span class="c0">Event Operations (Chair: Emily Drevets)</span>
*   <span class="c0">Fundraising and Finances (Chair: Derek Eder)</span>
*   <span class="c0">Membership Management (Chair: Mieko Furuhashi)</span>
*   <span class="c0">Onboarding (Chair: Emily Drevets)</span>
*   <span class="c0">Presenter Booking (Chair: Derek Eder)</span>
*   <span class="c0">Social Media (Chair: Katie O’Shea)</span>
*   <span class="c0">Website (Chair: Josh Kalov)</span>
*   <span class="c0">Elections (Chair: Josh Kalov)</span>

<span class="c0">In order to stagger membership and prevent a major loss of institutional knowledge, for this first year, 5 of the 11 members, were given 1 year terms, and the other 6 were given 2 year terms.</span>

<span class="c0">As the founder of Chi Hack Night, I (Derek Eder) have assumed the role of President. This role, however, along with all board positions, has been structured so that new members can be voted in or appointed.</span>

<span class="c0">We’re also a fun bunch! Over the summer we all got together for a picnic and a visit to the Shedd Aquarium with a personalized tour led by Cameron (he works there).</span>

## <span class="c26">We have 41 voting Chi Hack Night Members</span>

<span class="c0">One of the main reasons we formed Chi Hack Night as a membership-based organization was to create a pathway for people to grow and build their networks and careers in civic tech.</span>



<span>As a relatively new and nascent field, there are very few official pathways to advance in civic tech. This was well documented and captured in the</span> <span class="c5">[More than Code report](https://morethancode.cc/T4SJ_fullreport_082018_AY_web.pdf&sa=D&ust=1580861934098000)</span> <span>released in 2018, specifically their</span> <span class="c5">[practitioner experiences](https://morethancode.cc/report/practitioners/&sa=D&ust=1580861934098000)</span><span class="c0">.</span>

<span class="c0">  
This was something we wanted to change. By establishing a clear set of rules to follow, we are giving the civic tech community in Chicago a pathway to becoming more engaged, to earn and exercise their power, and to eventually become new leaders in our space.</span>

<span class="c0">If you’re interested in learning more about our Membership setup, we gave a presentation on it in May:</span>

<span class="c0">The Chi Hack Night Membership team, led by Mieko Furuhashi and Steve Ediger, established our process for vetting and organizing our initial cohort of Members.</span>

<span>As of this writing, Chi Hack Night has 41 official voting Members. These members will gather on Feb 4th, 2020 for our first ever General Meeting, where we will</span> <span class="c5">[vote on new Directors for our Board and changes in our Bylaws](https://chihacknight.org/blog/2020/01/14/board-elections.html&sa=D&ust=1580861934100000)</span><span>.</span>
