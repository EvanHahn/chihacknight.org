Stand up for democracy!

On Tuesday February 9, 2021, Chi Hack Night will hold our second election for our [Board of Directors](https://chihacknight.org/board-of-directors.html). The Chi Hack Night Board of Directors, composed of 11 members, is responsible for governing our non-profit organization, as well as running our events, managing our website, keeping the books, and doing all the other things needed to make Chi Hack Night happen.

There are a total of 6 seats up in this election. Four of them will be chosen by Chi Hack Night Members based on popular vote and two will be appointed by the current Board of Directors with majority Membership approval. All of the seats are 2 year terms, with the exception of one Board seat vacated after year 1; this seat will be filled for the remaining 1 year of the term.

Here’s a breakdown of the available seats:

## What would my responsibilities as a Board member be?

Being on the Chi Hack Night Board of Directors is a volunteer position and we have no paid staff. All of the work of Chi Hack Night is done by the Board and other volunteers. The Board is divided up into 10 committees responsible for a core function of Chi Hack Night:



*   Breakout Group Support
*   Community Engagement
*   Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
*   Event Operations
*   Fundraising and Finances
*   Membership
*   Onboarding
*   Booking
*   Social Media
*   Website

You will be expected to join several of these committees to support Chi Hack Night’s objectives and volunteer your time to them. In addition, you will be expected to attend or call in to 9 Board meetings a year. You will not be expected to make any financial contribution to Chi Hack Night.
