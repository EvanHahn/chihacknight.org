## What would my responsibilities as a Board member be?

Being on the Chi Hack Night Board of Directors is a volunteer position and we have no paid staff. All of the work of Chi Hack Night is done by the Board and other volunteers. The Board is divided up into committees responsible for a core function of Chi Hack Night:
- Event Ops 
- Membership & Volunteers
- Communications & Promotion


You will be expected to join one or two of these committees to support Chi Hack Night’s objectives and volunteer your time to them. In addition, you will be expected to attend or call in to 9 Board meetings a year. You will not be expected to make any financial contribution to Chi Hack Night.

Have questions about the election process? Let us know at info@chihacknight.org. Want to know what it’s like to serve on the Board? Send a Slack message to any of our current Board members and we’d be happy to share our experiences.

Yay democracy and long live Chi Hack Night! We’ll see you online for the Board election on *Tuesday, February 7, 2023*.
