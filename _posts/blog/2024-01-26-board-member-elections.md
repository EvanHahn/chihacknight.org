On Tuesday, February 13, 2024, Chi Hack Night will hold our fifth annual member meeting and election for our [Board of Directors](https://chihacknight.org/board-of-directors.html). The Chi Hack Night Board of Directors, composed of 11 members, is responsible for governing our non-profit organization, as well as running our events, managing our website, keeping the books, and doing all the other things needed to make Chi Hack Night happen.

There are a total of seven seats up in this election. Three of them will be chosen by Chi Hack Night Members based on popular vote and four will be appointed by the current Board of Directors with majority Membership approval. Six of the seats are 2 year terms. One of the seats is an appointed seat to fill a vacancy and is a 1 year term.

Here’s a breakdown of the available seats:

## What would my responsibilities as a Board member be?

Being on the Chi Hack Night Board of Directors is a volunteer position and we have no paid staff. All of the work of Chi Hack Night is done by the Board and other volunteers. The Board is divided up into committees responsible for a core function of Chi Hack Night:

* Event Ops 
* Membership & Volunteers
* Communications & Promotion

You will be expected to join one or two of these committees to support Chi Hack Night’s objectives and volunteer your time to them. In addition, you will be expected to attend or call in to 9 Board meetings a year. You will not be expected to make any financial contribution to Chi Hack Night.

Have questions about the election process? Let us know at [info@chihacknight.org](mailto:info@chihacknight.org). Want to know what it’s like to serve on the Board? Send a Slack message to any of our current Board members and we’d be happy to share our experiences.

Yay democracy and long live Chi Hack Night! We’ll see you online for the Board election on **Tuesday, February 13, 2024**.
