On Tuesday, February 18, 2025, Chi Hack Night will hold our sixth annual member meeting and election for our [Board of Directors](https://chihacknight.org/board-of-directors.html).

There are a total of five seats up in this election. Three of them will be chosen by Chi Hack Night Members based on popular vote and two will be appointed by the current Board of Directors with majority Membership approval. All of the seats are two-year terms.

* Event Ops 
* Membership & Volunteers
* Communications & Promotion

You will be expected to join one or two of these committees to support Chi Hack Night’s objectives and volunteer your time to them. In addition, you will be expected to attend or call in to 9 Board meetings a year. You will not be expected to make any financial contribution to Chi Hack Night.
