</p>

Ahead of our fourth annual Member Meeting and Board Elections on Feb 7, 2023, we’re publishing our 2022 year in review to share with our Members and our community (that’s you!).

As we look ahead to 2023, we also look back at what we did in 2022. Here we go …

For those newer to Chi Hack Night, this is the eighth “year in review” that we have done. Take a look at our year-in-review posts from [2021](https://chihacknight.org/blog/2022/02/22/2021-year-in-review.html), [2020](https://chihacknight.org/blog/2021/02/06/2020-year-in-review.html), [2019](https://chihacknight.org/blog/2020/02/04/2019-year-in-review.html), [2017](https://chihacknight.org/blog/2018/01/04/2017-year-in-review.html),[ 2016](https://chihacknight.org/blog/2016/12/31/2016-year-in-review.html),[ 2015](https://chihacknight.org/blog/2015/12/22/chi-hack-night-2015-year-in-review.html), and[ 2014](https://chihacknight.org/blog/2015/01/06/open-gov-hack-night-2014-year-in-review.html) to follow along how we got here.

In that tradition, here are the high-level statistics for Chi Hack Night in 2022:

* We put on 48 Chi Hack Night events. If it's Tuesday, even during a pandemic, it's hack night!
* We had [34 presentations](#we-had-34-presentations-11-in-person) with topics covering climate change, education, equity, govetch, journalism, and more!
* We held our [third annual Member Meeting and board election](#we-held-our-third-board-elections)
* We held a hybrid [community feedback session](#march-2022-community-feedback-session)
* We celebrated our [500th Chi Hack Night episode](#we-held-our-500th-episode)
* We simplified the [committees our Board uses](#new-board-committee-structures) to get work done
* We streamlined the [renewal process for our membership](#updates-to-our-membership-process)
* We remain [financially stable](#finances)
* We updated and set new [objectives and key results (OKRs)](#objectives-and-key-results-okrs) for our organization

And with that, let’s dive in.

## We held our third board elections {#we-held-our-third-board-elections}

<p class="text-center"><img src="/images/blog/2022-board-elected.jpg" alt="From top left, 2022 elected and appointed seats: Michael Chladek, Sean Watland, Eric Sherman, Cameron Sow and Laurie Merrell." class='img-responsive'/><br /><em>From top left, 2022 elected and appointed seats: Michael Chladek, Sean Watland, Eric Sherman, Cameron Sow and Laurie Merrell.</em>
</p>

On Feb 22nd, we held our third election for our [Board of Directors](https://chihacknight.org/board-of-directors.html). We were amazed at the turnout. Of our 57 official Members, 26 attended virtually to cast their votes. 

There were three members chosen by Chi Hack Night Members based on popular vote and two appointed by the current Board of Directors with majority Membership approval. All board members serve 2 year terms.

The elected members of the Board were: Michael Chladek, Eric Sherman, and Sean Watland. The appointed Board members approved by the Membership were Cameron Sow and Laurie Merrell. After the election, the Board still had one vacancy and in August, we appointed Shriya Jalukar as our 11th Board member.

Before the upcoming election in 2023, we’d like to give a special thank you to Samantha Evans and Steve Luker! They will not be seeking another term on the Board at Chi Hack Night, but will certainly be missed! Thank you for all you’ve done for the Chi Hack Night Community! 


## March 2022 Community Feedback Session {#march-2022-community-feedback-session}

<p class="text-center"><img src="/images/blog/2022-04-29-march-2022-community-feedback/20220315_community_feedback_miro_board.jpg" alt="Responses from the March 15, 2022 community feedback session" class='img-responsive'/><br /><em>Responses from the March 15, 2022 community feedback session</em></p>

On March 15th, [Chi Hack Night hosted a community feedback session](https://chihacknight.org/blog/2022/04/29/march-2022-community-feedback.html) to gather how folks are feeling about their communities while still dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic, how are folks feeling about Chi Hack Night, and what changes they might like to see in the coming months. 

Similar to the results we saw in prior feedback sessions, feedback contained a mix of optimism and anxiety about the future. Many comments centered on the challenges and opportunities of online, hybrid, and in-person events, with a variety of opinions expressed but seeming general consensus that Chi Hack Night should plan to continue with hybrid offerings.

This community feedback session was more inwardly focused than our mostly post-election session last year, with a primary emphasis on Chi Hack Night operations during the current phase of the pandemic.

While there was some ambivalence about how well Chi Hack Night has achieved hybrid programming thus far, there was a strong and shared interest in figuring out how to continually improve and how to ensure that Chi Hack Night remains an inclusive and accessible space for Chicagoans to get involved in civic technology through the pandemic and beyond.


## We held our 500th episode {#we-held-our-500th-episode}

<p class="text-center"><img src="/images/blog/2022-year-in-review/500-derek-emily.jpg" alt="Co-hosts Derek Eder and Emily Drevets at CHN 500" class='img-responsive'/><br /><em>Co-hosts Derek Eder and Emily Drevets at CHN 500</em></p>

July 12, 2022 marked the 500th episode of Chi Hack Night. That’s 10 years!

For this very special in-person hack night we featured 7 lightning talks answering the question ‘how has Chi Hack Night impacted you or your organization?’ You can watch each of them here:

1. [Eric Sherman - How I Chi Hacked My Life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMluh3rCnLY)
2. [Kyla Williams Tate - Civic Leadership Springboard (pre-recorded)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1hO6_-o4a4)
3. [Derek Eder - Decarb My State](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=coX6Gh0uKvI)
4. [Emily Drevets-Larson - Start where you are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hetSO0JqOQE)
5. [Michael Chladek - Chicago Media Justice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RPxGrXLiDc)
6. [Laurie Merrell - The #jobs Channel & Me: How CHN facilitated my career switch into (civic) tech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDfKirpxPks)
7. [Nick Lucius - From Lawyer to Chicago’s CTO (pre-recorded)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7-APONeLwY)

There was also:

* tacos!
* cupcakes!
* a photo booth!
* friends!
* and, of course, civic hacking fun for all!

## New board committee structures {#new-board-committee-structures}

In 2022, the Board adopted new committee structures to better align with the core functions of Chi Hack Night. At the start of this year, the Board had **9** committees (yes, we realize that was way too many!). Each board member was generally a part of 3 to 4. 

After we revised our organization’s OKRs, or goals, we asked the question: _do our current committees align with our OKRs? _After some consideration, we decided they did not and there were more than we needed.

<p class="text-center"><img src="/images/blog/2022-year-in-review/okr-miro-board.jpg" alt="The Board, led by Sean Watland, reorganized our committees into more manageable groupings that aligned with our organization’s key goals." class='img-responsive'/><br /><em>The Board, led by Sean Watland, reorganized our committees into more manageable groupings that aligned with our organization’s key goals.</em></p>

In August 2022, the Board decided to pare down our committees into just **3**: 

1. Event Ops
2. Membership & Volunteers
3. Communications & Promotion


## Updates to our membership process {#updates-to-our-membership-process}

As you may know, Chi Hack Night is a [Membership based non-profit](https://chihacknight.org/membership/application.html). The membership votes on our Board of Directors and our bylaws.

In December of 2022, we held a special member meeting where members voted on two proposed changes to Chi Hack Night’s [bylaws](https://chihacknight.org/docs/ChiHackNightBylawsAmended20-02-04.pdf) to make the renewal process more straightforward. We had 18 members attend, who unanimously approved the two amendments. 

Members will now need to renew their membership on an annual basis and the specific qualifications required for membership were removed from the bylaws themselves in order to allow greater flexibility to explore other models of what membership qualifications may look like in our remote / in-person hybrid future.

## Finances {#finances}

Chi Hack Night continues to remain financially stable and is in a good position to cover a potential increase in in-person events for 2023. The return of in-person events in 2022 meant increased expenses compared to 2021, although expenses remained substantially lower than they were pre-pandemic. 

In 2022, we received donations from several individuals throughout the year (thank you to those who donated!) and saw the return of organizations providing sponsorship donations to Chi Hack Night (thank you, Open Tech Strategies and DataMade!).

With the return of in-person events, the main expenses for 2022 included professionally recording and editing the in-person presentations as well as providing food at such events. We also saw an increase in presenters taking advantage of Chi Hack Night’s honorarium for speakers.

## Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) {#objectives-and-key-results-okrs}

In 2020, the Chi Hack Night board set out to create and measure [Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) for our organization](https://chihacknight.org/blog/2021/02/06/2020-year-in-review.html#goals). After establishing our OKRs, we assigned each of them to the relevant committee and tracked and measured the progress at our regular board meetings. In July 2022, a group of Board Members met and set our OKRs for 2022. As we set these new OKRs in the middle of the year, we will not fully measure them until Summer 2023. 

From our 2021 OKRs, we tried to organize our OKRs around core functions of what it takes to keep Chi Hack Night running.  We settled on 4 Objectives: 

1. Run the Event
2. Sustain the Event
3. Promote the Event
4. Ensure attendees get value from the Event

While we are not on track to hit all of our OKRs, we feel proud of the work we have accomplished over this past year. As always, we will continue to grow and improve as a board with each year. 

Below are each of our OKRs and how we are tracking towards hitting them. 

**Progress Key**
