description: "On November 16, 2021 at 6pm, in-person Chi Hack Night will return! After 20 months and 75 remote hack nights, we’re excited to bring Chi Hack Night back to the physical world. With COVID cases decreasing in Chicagoland and adult vaccination rates up to 75%, we feel that it is safe again to gather for a masked evening of socializing, learning, and civic hacking. Oh, how we’ve missed you!"

For our return to in-person, Chi Hack Night will be hosted at [TeamWorking at TechNexus](https://teamworking.vc/), located in the [Civic Opera Building in downtown Chicago](https://goo.gl/maps/xcdjbHx7PYsefjBh6). At the event, we will hear a [presentation from Mike Strode at Open Collective Foundation](/events/2021/11/16/mike-strode.html), socialize, and hold space for [breakout groups](https://chihacknight.org/breakouts.html). 

If you can’t make it in person, we will be streaming the presentation on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/chihacknight/live). Either way, we hope to see you at 6pm on Tuesday!

**Q: I won’t be able to make it in person. Will the event be live streamed?**<br />
A: Yes. The event will be livestreamed on our YouTube channel: [youtube.com/chihacknight/live](https://www.youtube.com/chihacknight/live)

**Q: Will COVID-19 vaccination be required?**<br />
A: Yes. In order to keep attendees safe, we will be requiring proof of vaccination at the door. A physical vaccine cards or picture of one will be accepted. If you are not vaccinated, you can tune in to the [livestream](https://www.youtube.com/chihacknight/live).

**Q: Will masks be required?**<br />

**Q: Will there be food?**<br />
A: Serving communal food in a pandemic is a tricky problem. For our first go-around, we will be providing some light snacks and drinks, so you may want to grab some dinner ahead of time!

**Q: Why is this event hosted at TechNexus?**<br />
A: We canvassed many offices in downtown Chicago and many are not hosting in-person events yet, including our old hosts Braintree. TeamWorking at TechNexus was excited to host us, so we went for it! Their office is in the historic [Civic Opera Building](https://civicoperachicago.com), which thematically is a great fit for a civic tech event!

**Q: Do I have to register to attend?**<br />
A: To gauge the number of attendees, we ask that everyone [RSVPs on Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/in-person-chi-hack-night-tickets-207988107027).

**Q: Will Chi Hack Night be meeting in person every week?**<br />
A: For starters, we are planning on meeting in-person once a month, with remote events in between. We plan to be back with another in-person event on December 14th.

**Q: Can I volunteer at the event?**<br />
A: Yes you can! If you can show up at 5:30p, we would love help setting up the space. If you’re interested, email [info@chihacknight.org](mailto:info@chihacknight.org).
