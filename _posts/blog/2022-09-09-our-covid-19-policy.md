title: "Our COVID-19 Policy"
description: "At Chi Hack Night we continue to believe in the importance of hosting in-person events particularly in a time where meaningful social life is so vital, but we must work together to do so safely. We recognize our civic responsibility of standing in solidarity with marginalized communities, particularly as they have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic. As such, we have created a policy for protecting our community from COVID-19."

_Updated June 7, 2023_
### Updated Policy
As stated in our initial policy below, the Board considers updates to our COVID-19 policy when we feel it appropriate. As of June 2023, we have made the decision to drop **proof of vaccination** as a requirement for our In Person events. 

We continue asking that all attendees wear a mask while attending our In Person Events. 

As always, we appreciate the commitment of all our attendees who help contribute to a welcoming and safe environment for all. If the board deems it appropriate to make further changes to our COVID-19 policy, we will update this policy and notify our community.

### Initial Policy
At Chi Hack Night we continue to believe in the importance of hosting in-person events particularly in a time where meaningful social life is so vital, but we must work together to do so safely. We recognize our civic responsibility of standing in solidarity with marginalized communities, particularly as they have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic. As such, we have created a policy for protecting our community from  COVID-19.

 **Ventilation** and **masking** have been consistently demonstrated to be effective mitigation strategies particularly when coupled with **vaccination**. We take these measures to make sure everyone feels safe and welcome in an already stressful time. We appreciate the fact that some people have unique home or health circumstances that require them to take precaution measures. 

This includes people with underlying health conditions for whom the risks of infection can be particularly outsized. It also includes people caring for loved ones with health conditions. We also acknowledge a range of additional personal and home circumstances that might require people to take additional precautions; we stand in solidarity with all our fellow Chicagoans.

**To protect our community from COVID-19 during in-person events, we will:**

* Require proof of vaccination to attend in-person (vaccination card)
* Open windows to provide additional ventilation (weather/temperature permitting)
* Require proper masking unless actively eating, drinking, or presenting
    * Friendly, respectful, understanding but consistent reminders and enforcement of our masking policy
    * Clear eating area designation
* Monitor transmission trends and variants consistent with CDC, City, and County guidance
* Seek input from our membership and attendees
* Respect people's preferences and boundaries, striving to be open and responsive to our communitiesâ€™ expressed needs, preferences and requests for accommodation 
* Provide clear and consistent communication including
    * Announcements
    * Blog posts
    * Slack reminders
    * Social media

We will adjust our responses we deem necessary to maintain safe events. We recognize that the current reality is that we are likely undercounting COVID-19 cases.

Chi Hack Night is a volunteer and community effort. While our Board of Directors is responsible for communicating and enforcing these policies, volunteers and breakout group leaders also share this responsibility in their roles. We ask that Members and regular attendees also help with normalizing these behaviors, but ask that they refrain from any confrontation or enforcement and report any issues to an available Board member or email [info@chihacknight.org](mailto:info@chihacknight.org).

With your continued support we can continue to ensure safe in-person Chi Hack Nights!
