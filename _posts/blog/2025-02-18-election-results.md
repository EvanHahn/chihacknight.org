On Feb 18th, we held our sixth election for our [Board of Directors](https://chihacknight.org/board-of-directors.html). We were amazed at the turnout. Of our 26 official Members, 22 attended virtually to cast their votes.

There were three members chosen by Chi Hack Night Members based on popular vote and two appointed by the current Board of Directors with majority Membership approval. All board members serve 2 year terms. Below are the results and vote tallys. 

The elected members of the Board are:

* **Derek Eder (incumbent)** - 22 votes ☑️ 
* **Josh Kalov (incumbent)** - 22 votes ☑️ 
* **Katie O'Shea (incumbent)** - 22 votes ☑️ 


The appointed Board member approved by the Membership is: 

* **Adam Hecktman (incumbent)** - 22 votes ☑️ 
* **Vien Nguyen (incumbent)** - 22 votes ☑️ 


### General Meeting and election process
Voting took place at our Member Meeting, which happens once a year in February. President Sean Watland and Treasurer Michael Chladek presented our [2024 Year in Review](https://chihacknight.org/blog/2025/02/16/2024-year-in-review) and reviewed our organizational finances. We then heard from each of the candidates running for elected or appointed seats. You can [read their candidate statements here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RhDpKC6KhIkySLsU4JZlmhHm6yXvwCqcYWXTweEOo4M/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.g0wx1a77hdyh).
