As we enter into the second month of staying at home and the world being turned upside down by COVID-19, we’d like to share what Chi Hack Night has been up to, as well as some exciting updates.

As you likely already know, Chi Hack Night is now a completely [remote event](/blog/2020/03/16/chi-hack-night-going-remote.html) and community for the foreseeable future. We are committed to bringing you weekly Tuesday events via [livestream](https://www.youtube.com/chihacknight/live) and organizing our Slack community — [join here](http://slackme.chihacknight.org/)! 

We’ve also [rallied around ways to help those affected](/blog/2020/03/23/guide-to-helping-out-during-the-covid-19-outbreak.html) by the COVID-19 crisis and the economic fallout from the necessary shutdown orders. In the coming weeks, we will be rolling out some new ways to volunteer and get better connected to members of the Chi Hack Night community.

Now, on to the updates!

**Chi Hack Night is now a 501(c)(3) organization!**

As of April 3rd, 2020, Chi Hack Night NFP has officially received our 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status from the IRS! We are now a fully-fledged non-profit organization!

</p>

A very special thanks to Jeremy Mandell and Kevin Mausert from [Kirkland & Ellis](https://www.kirkland.com/) for their pro bono legal assistance. It would not have been possible without them!

With this designation, all [donations to Chi Hack Night](/donate/) are now tax-deductible and we are now eligible to apply for funding from foundations and other charitable organizations.

**We are having a Member meeting on May 26th during Chi Hack Night**

When we incorporated as a non-profit, we did so as a member-based organization. We are planning to bring our Members together so that we can check in with each other, provide updates to them, and discuss ways that Chi Hack Night can continue to adapt to serve our community moving forward. If you’re a Member, we look forward to seeing you then. 

You can learn more about what it means to be a Member [here](/membership/application.html).

**Chi Hack Night’s 400 episode is on June 2nd, 2020. Share a short video to help celebrate!**

June 2nd, 2020 will mark the 400th episode of Chi Hack Night. That's 8 years! In celebration, we're collecting short (30 seconds or less) videos from Chi Hack Night Members, speakers and alumni.

Has Chi Hack Night affected you in some way? Did you work on a meaningful project? Make a new friend? Land a job? We want to hear from you!

We'll share it at Chi Hack Night on June 2nd!
