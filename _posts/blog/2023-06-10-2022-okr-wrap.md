Since 2021, the Board of Directors have planned yearly goals to ensure that we are focusing our efforts around things that make Chi Hack Night successful. For the second year, we continued using an **OKR** framework to plan our goals. 

*If you are curious to learn more about OKRs and how they work, here's an [article](https://www.whatmatters.com/faqs/okr-meaning-definition-example) that shares more about how they work.*

**OKRs** (short for **Objective** & **Key Results**) help us know: 
1. What are our important focus areas - the **Objectives** 
2. How do we know we've succeeded - the **Key Results**

For our second round of OKRs, we settled on **4 Objectives** as a Board.
1. **Run the event**
2. **Sustain the event**
3. **Promote the event**
4. **Ensure attendees get value from the event**

Before we get into our results, I want to acknowledge how proud I am of the Board for all of their work towards these OKRs and commitment to seeing Chi Hack Night grow. For a Board made up of all volunteers, we achieved quite a lot! With all of our successes, it is also important to acknowledge areas where we were stretched and learnings we had along the way. For as much as we achieved, we still fell short of our plan in a few areas. 

To help make sense of official results below, here are some highlights & learnings I'd like to share from this past year: 

## Where we succeeded
  1. **Running the Event** - Our Event Ops did an excellent job of booking excellent presenters from a wide range of interests and backgrounds.

  2. **Spreading out Operational Responsibility** - It's no secret that Derek Eder (our President Emeritus) had a big role in many of the operational needs for Chi Hack Night for many years - from booking speakers, hosting, and the most important task of *ordering tacos*, Derek contributed in every area. While we are incredibly grateful for those contributions, it was not the most organizationally sustainable. Yet, with a few of our KRs, I'm thrilled to say we have made significant strides to spread these out. 

  3. **Editing our Bylaws around Membership** - With our membership roll up in numbers but actively engaged membership numbers down, we were getting to a tough spot where our organization could potentially struggle to meet the minimum number of members needed needed to make official changes to our organization - like voting in new Board of Directors for example. **Yikes!** Thankfully, our Membership & Volunteers committee created a new membership renewal process that we successfully voted on during the our last Member Meeting to help with this impending problem.

## Where we made progress
  1. **Engaging Non-Board Member Volunteers** - Until around March 2023, every single volunteer need had been filled by a Board Member. Recently, we've seen a handful of new and returning non-board member volunteers contribute by hosting a few presentations or by serving as greeters for our in person events. This is a great new trend and it is important that we find ways to continue engaging our non-board member volunteers. 

  2. **Brand New Attendee Experience** - We had a few KRs planned around improving the experience of folks who are attending Chi Hack Night for the first time. For example, we changed **Civic Tech 101** to **Welcome to Chi Hack Night** to make that content more consistent and focused around Chi Hack Night. While we've been hosting this more often, we have not been hosting it consistently. 

  3. **Membership Application & Renewal Process** - While we definitely made improvements to the renewal process for Chi Hack Night as an organization, none of the Board feels that we made strides to make the requirements and application process better for current & prospective members. _Spoiler alert: this will be a focus during the upcoming months._

## Where we could grow
1. **Promoting the event** - We made some strides towards understanding what metrics matter for us in promoting our event. However, we were not able to come up with strategy on _how we should_ promote the event. That being said, I'm proud of the learnings that came from this process as that will better set us up for changes in the coming year. 

2. **Learning Groups** - We had very few hack nights where someone was hosting a **learning group** - meaning the goal of the group is to learn a new skill (like Python, Javascript, digital security, etc) rather than building out an application or website. These are great opportunities for beginners - so this still feels like an important area to grow. 


In short, we achieved and learned quite a bit over the past year. I'm proud of our Board of Directors and our dedicated community who help make Chi Hack Night better every week. 

Stay tuned for our upcoming round of OKRs which will be announced in a couple weeks!
