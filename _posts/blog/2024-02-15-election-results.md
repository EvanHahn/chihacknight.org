On Feb 13th, we held our fifth election for our [Board of Directors](https://chihacknight.org/board-of-directors.html). We were amazed at the turnout. Of our 28 official Members, 22 attended virtually to cast their votes.

There were three members chosen by Chi Hack Night Members based on popular vote and one appointed by the current Board of Directors with majority Membership approval. All board members serve 2 year terms. Below are the results and vote tallys. 

The elected members of the Board are:

* **Michael Chladek (incumbent)** - 22 votes ☑️ 
* **Kyle Dolezal** - 21 votes ☑️ 
* **Sean Watland (incumbent)** - 22 votes ☑️ 


The appointed Board member approved by the Membership is: 

* **Samantha Goodman** - 22 votes ☑️ 
* **Sneha Jalukar (incumbent)** - 22 votes ☑️ 
* **Cameron Sow (incumbent)** - 22 votes ☑️ 


### General Meeting and election process
Voting took place at our Member Meeting, which happens once a year in February. President Sean Watland and Treasurer Michael Chladek presented our [2023 Year in Review](/blog/2024/02/14/2023-year-in-review) and reviewed our organizational finances. We then heard from each of the candidates running for elected or appointed seats. You can [read their candidate statements here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V01iUsbq14xLqqG2VaIM_E-9fLyFofXoYLSbo9RaS58/edit#).

### Thank you to outgoing Board Members!
Two Board Members, Laurie Merrell and Eric Sherman did not run for re-election this cycle and have concluded their term on our Board of Directors. A HUGE thank you to both of you for all you have done for our organization and community!
