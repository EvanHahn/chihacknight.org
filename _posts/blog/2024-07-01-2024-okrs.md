On June 1st, 2024, the Board of Directors held our second in-person *board retreat*! This retreat served as an excellent opportunity for the 10 Board of Directors to have more focused discussions around what membership means at Chi Hack Night, plan our upcoming **OKRs** for the year, and enjoy copious amounts of bagels & coffee. 

Our retreat was held from 10 am until 3 pm, downtown Chicago at [dscout](www.dscout.com) corporate headquarters. (Thank you [dscout](www.dscout.com) for graciously hosting us for the day!)

Through our discussions, the board identified three primary goals for the upcoming year: 
1. Continuing to run a high quality civic tech event
2. Expand the broader awareness of Chi Hack Night
3. How might we use this broader awareness to bring in more financial support for Chi Hack Night

For the third year, we've used an **OKR** framework to plan and measure our goals. **OKRs** (short for **Objective** & **Key Results**) help us know: 
1. What are our important focus areas - the **Objectives** 
2. How do we know we've succeeded - the **Key Results**

*If you are curious to learn more about OKRs and how they work, here's an [article](https://www.whatmatters.com/faqs/okr-meaning-definition-example) that shares more about how they work.*

While you'll see and hear more about the specifics as we work on these throughout the year, we wanted to share these out now so that our wider community can see what we're planning to focus on in the coming months.

# Wrapping Up our 2023-2024 OKRs
Before signing off for this post, we also wanted to report out on how we did on our previous year's OKRs. I am quite proud of the work our Board & other volunteers did for Chi Hack Night this year. It's truly a team effort and none of this could have been possible without all of us. 

As for our OKRs, we did a bang up job making some serious strides this year! In short, we achieved 6 KRs, nearly achieved 2 KRs, and missed on only 1 KR.

If you're curious to learn more, below is a breakdown of how we did for our previous year's OKRs.
