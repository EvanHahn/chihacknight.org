Tuesday, Feb 5, 6pm<br />
Braintree<br />
222 W Merchandise Mart Plz, 8th Floor<br />
Chicago, IL 60654

Local government bodies hold thousands of public meetings every day, but the vast majority receive no media coverage and produce minimal records. And these important spaces for democracy go unwatched. Long story short, your city officials are making big decisions.[ Documenters.org](https://www.documenters.org/) makes it easy to keep tabs by[ scraping, standardizing and sharing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF3s_eOQsKo) information on public meetings at the city and county-level in Chicago and Detroit—all in one central location.

[Darryl Holliday](https://twitter.com/d_holli), City Bureau News Lab Director and Pat Sier, City Bureau Web Developer will present the new Documenters.org website and talk about how it complements [City Bureau](https://www.citybureau.org/)’s two-year-old Documenters program, which has been training and paying members of the public to document public governance meetings in Chicago since 2016.

**February 12th - Open Hack & Potluck**

Chi Hack Night is proud to be partnering with and supporting the National Association of Black Journalists during Black History Month.

Timuel Black, elder statesman and griot of Chicago's black community, turned 100 on Dec. 7. The momentous birthday was accompanied by a weekend of Chicago celebrations for the historian, author, political and civil rights activist.

Black worked with activists Paul Robeson and W.E.B. DuBois in the '40s and '50s; alongside Dr. Martin Luther King in the '60s. He was heavily involved in King's Chicago Freedom Movement, and helped organize Chicagoans' participation in the '63 March on Washington. Over the course of seven decades, he helped establish and was active in over 100 civil rights/labor organizations. And Black was instrumental in the election of Chicago's first black mayor, in 1983, as well as the election of the nation's first black president, in 2008. NABJ-Chicago will to host a fireside chat with this icon at our annual Black History Month Forum.
