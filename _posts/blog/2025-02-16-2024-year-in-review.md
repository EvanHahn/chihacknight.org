Ahead of our sixth annual Member Meeting and Board Elections on Feb 18, 2025, we’re publishing our 2024 year in review to share with our Members and our community (that’s you!).

As we look ahead to 2025, we also look back at what we did in 2024. Here we go …

For those newer to Chi Hack Night, this is the tenth “year in review” that we have done. Take a look at our year-in-review posts from [2023](https://chihacknight.org/blog/2024/02/14/2023-year-in-review),

## Finances {#finances}

Chi Hack Night continues to remain financially stable and is in a good position to continue covering our remote as well as hybrid remote/in-person events well into 2025.

In 2024, we saw a noticable uptick in donations received from individuals throughout the year (thank you to those who donated, especially those donated multiple times or are contributing on a monthly basis!). We also had additional organizations provide sponsorship donations to Chi Hack Night (thank you, CompTIA, For Good Advisory, and DataMade!).

In-person events remained the main expense for 2024, which included professionally recording and editing the in-person presentations as well as providing food, snacks, and supplies at such events. We also saw presenters continuing to take advantage of Chi Hack Night’s honorarium for speakers.

## Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) {#objectives-and-key-results-okrs}

For our 5th year, the Board has been using OKRs to prioritize what we’ve determined to be areas to focus our efforts to improve our event & build our community. Below, we will recap how we are doing halfway into our [2024 - 25 OKRs](https://chihacknight.org/blog/2024/08/22/2024-okrs).
