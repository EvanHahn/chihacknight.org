Ahead of our sixth annual Member Meeting and Board Elections on Feb 18, 2024, we’re publishing our 2024 year in review to share with our Members and our community (that’s you!).

As we look ahead to 2025, we also look back at what we did in 2024. Here we go …

For those newer to Chi Hack Night, this is the ninth “year in review” that we have done. Take a look at our year-in-review posts from [2023](https://chihacknight.org/blog/2024/02/14/2023-year-in-review),

## Finances {#finances}

Chi Hack Night continues to remain financially stable and is in a good position to continue covering our remote as well as hybrid remote/in-person events well into 2024. Expenses remained substantially lower than they were pre-pandemic, although we did have higher legal and licensing/registration expenses in 2023 as we worked with our lawyer to resolve an error in our registration with the Illinois Attorney General’s office.

In 2023, we received donations from several individuals throughout the year (thank you to those who donated, especially those contributing on a monthly basis!). We also continued to see  organizations providing sponsorship donations to Chi Hack Night (thank you, Chicago Cityscape and DataMade!).

In-person events remained the main expense for 2023, which included professionally recording and editing the in-person presentations as well as providing food, snacks, and supplies at such events. We also saw presenters continuing to take advantage of Chi Hack Night’s honorarium for speakers.
