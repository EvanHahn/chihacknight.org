On Feb 22nd, we held our third election for our [Board of Directors](https://chihacknight.org/board-of-directors.html). We were amazed at the turnout. Of our 57 official Members, 26 attended virtually to cast their votes. 

There were three members chosen by Chi Hack Night Members based on popular vote and two appointed by the current Board of Directors with majority Membership approval. All board members serve 2 year terms.

The elected members of the Board are:

* **Michael Chladek (incumbent)**
* **Eric Sherman (incumbent)**
* **Sean Watland**

The appointed Board members approved by the Membership are: 

* **Cameron Sow (incumbent)**

### General Meeting and election process
Voting took place at our General Meeting, which happens once a year according to our [Bylaws](/docs/ChiHackNightBylawsAmended20-02-04.pdf). This meeting was for Chi Hack Night Members only. At the meeting we followed [this agenda](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1akp7Mqn_3YEQ_7_ezbmHc0cBa3OQLY-eb9G04nheK8M/edit?usp=sharing). We also heard from each of the candidates running for elected or appointed seats. You can [read their candidate statements here](https://bit.ly/chn-candidates-2022).

The votes were cast by 26 Chi Hack Night Members virtually using a digital ballot. The results were tallied by Chi Hack Night Member Steve Ediger.

The final vote tallies are below:
