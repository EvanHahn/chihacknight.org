description: "Our project collects media reporting in Chicago on crime, violence and justice issues through scraping of the websites of the Chicago media. We use algorithms we trained to categorize the type of crime covered in the article as well as extract ego-location data and tag each article with a location. This is a project we started internally in 2011 before bringing to Chi Hack Night in late 2016."

The goal is to allow users to access near real-time analysis of disparities between how crime actually occurs in our city and how it is portrayed in the media. We will be building the ability to compare the reporting to crime incident data from the Chicago Police Department, call for police service data from the Office of Emergency Management & Communications. For our violence against women section we will also be adding aggregate data about from survivors seek the services of domestic violence and sexual assault service providers. 

The audience for this project is community members, policymakers, and the media itself. Our goal is to empower communities and policymakers with the tools to seek reform of media practices. For the media we hope this deep dive analysis of their work helps to motivate changes from within.
