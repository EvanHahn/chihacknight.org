# ChiCommons Cooperative 
[ChiCommons](https://www.chicommons.coop/) is a multi-stakeholder cooperative organization that grew out of Chi Hack Night  (CHN) and local environmental [Sustainability](https://www.ica-usa.org/chicagosustainability.html) movements. Our mission is to, cooperatively, foster and grow a people-owned solidarity economy.  We envision empowered, integrated, equitable, cooperative/solidarity economies across the Chicago region; connected globally. People living the " solidarity economy" practice common values such as cooperation, democracy, equality, justice, ecological sustainability, community, and respect for diversity.  We have formed as a self-sustaining Limited Cooperative Worker Association (LWCA) with many ways to get involved.
